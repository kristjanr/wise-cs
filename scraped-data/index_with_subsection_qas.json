You can see an estimate of how long it\u2019ll take by putting some basic details into our transfer calculator on our homepage.\n\nBut when you actually set up your transfer on Wise, your estimate will change. The reason for this is simple \u2014 the more information we have about your transfer, the more accurately we can tell you how long it\u2019ll take. And it depends on these 4 things:\n\n####  **The countries you\u2019re sending from and to.**\n\nEvery currency and country is different. Converting your money can take a maximum of 2 working days, but it\u2019s very rare that it takes this long. And how quick your transfer arrives depends on how quickly your recipient\u2019s bank can process your money, as well as the ways you can pay in the country you\u2019re sending from. We can't confirm when the money has reached and been processed by your recipient's bank.\n\n####  **How you pay.**\n\nSome payment methods are quicker than others. For instance, card payments are normally instant, while bank transfers can take longer, especially SWIFT transfers. You\u2019ll see how long each payment method takes when you set up your transfer.\n\n####  **What time you pay for your transfer.**\n\nWe can only move your money during normal banking hours. And things may take a little longer if the country you\u2019re sending to has a national holiday.\n\n####  **Security checks.**\n\nWe might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. We call this process verification, and it helps us keep you and your money safe. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer on top of the initial estimation.",

It\u2019s so you can see where your money is at every step. To check the money tracker:\n\n  1. Log in to your Wise account\n\n  2. Click **Details** on the transfer you\u2019d like to track\n\n\n\n\nToday, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer. Here are some of the most common reasons why your transfer might be delayed, and what you can do about them.\n\n### We might need to verify you\n\nDepending on how much you send and what currency you send to, we may need to do some extra verification. If we do, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.\n\n### The recipient\u2019s bank might be processing the transfer\n\nWhen the money tracker says **Transfer Sent** , it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient\u2019s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you\u2019re sending to. Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient.\n\n### There\u2019s a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details\n\nSometimes, transfers get delayed because there\u2019s a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they\u2019ll send the money back to us and we\u2019ll ask you to send it again.\n\nIf your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient\u2019s details. Here\u2019s what to do if you made a mistake.\n\n### What do I do now?\n\nIf we have paid out your money, but it hasn\u2019t settled in your recipient\u2019s account yet, you can speed up the process by sending a transfer receipt to the recipient\u2019s bank.\n\n  1. Go to **Home** to see your activity list\n\n  2. Click on **Details** on the relevant transfer\n\n  3. Click **Get PDF receipt**\n\n  4. Send the PDF to your recipient\u2019s bank",

But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it\u2019ll arrive, or why it\u2019s delayed.\n\n#### Wise says that my transfer\u2019s due to arrive today. \n\nGreat! Really that means your money should\u2019ve arrived already. We say that it\u2019s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us. \n\n#### My recipient\u2019s details may be wrong. \n\nSmall things like typos in names \u2014 for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time. However, for some currencies, such as JPY or RUB, a typo like this can be an issue. \n\nIf something like an account number is wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we\u2019ll let you know straight away. \n\n#### Transfers on weekends and holidays.\n\nNot all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you\u2019re sending money to.\n\nBut in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.\n\nThat means, if your money\u2019s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient\u2019s account until the next working day. We\u2019re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.\n\n#### My recipient says the money hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\n\nWe hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven\u2019t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:\n\n  *  **The sender name they\u2019re looking for.** Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.\n\n  *  **The recipient\u2019s bank details.** If they\u2019re not right, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. \n\n  * **The currency the recipient\u2019s account is in.** Your recipient\u2019s account may be in a currency that\u2019s different to the one you\u2019ve sent them. If that\u2019s the case, they could get a different amount from us because their bank might have converted the money.\n\n\n\n\n#### Getting a receipt.\n\nYour recipient\u2019s bank may be having problems processing your transfer. They\u2019ll have the money in their system, but won\u2019t have put it into your recipient\u2019s account. \n\nOur receipt includes all our bank details and, for some currencies, tracking numbers too. That means when your recipient gives it to their bank, the bank should have all the info they need to track down your transfer. \n\n**Here\u2019s how to get your receipt:**\n\n  1. Log into your Wise account\n\n  2. Click on your transfer \n\n  3. Click on the 3 dots on your browser to see a **Get PDF receipt** button, or click the button directly in the app\n\n  4. Save it to your device and send it to your recipient",

There are three main reasons this could happen when you use a card to pay for a transfer.\n\n### The bank that issued your card has charged an extra fee \u2014 often called a \u2018cash advance\u2019\n\nSome banks charge an extra fee when you use your card for a transfer. It works like this:\n\n  * When you pay for your transfer, Wise assigns a number called a Merchant Category Code (MCC) to your payment. MCCs help financial institutions categorise the kind of payment they\u2019re processing. \n\n  * Wise passes this MCC on to your bank \u2014 it\u2019s always 4829 or 6012, which indicates that your payment is a \u2018wire\u2019 or \u2018money order\u2019.\n\n  * Once the MCC we\u2019ve assigned reaches your bank, they can choose how to charge for it. Some banks charge a fee for certain MCCs.\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, banks sometimes charge your transfer as a \u2018cash advance\u2019 or \u2018cash withdrawal\u2019. And this could come with an extra charge. \n\nWise doesn\u2019t support this practice. But unfortunately, we have no control over it. It\u2019s totally at the discretion of the bank that issued your card.\n\n **Tip:** Call your bank and check how they charge for the MCC assigned to your payment. If they\u2019ve charged it as a cash advance or cash withdrawal, ask them why \u2014 and explain that the payment was not cash-related. They may be able to help.\n\n### The card was in a different currency than the currency you sent from\n\nHere\u2019s an example: imagine you\u2019ve sent GBP to USD. But the card you used was linked to a bank account that holds EUR.\n\nBecause the currency you paid with (EUR) was different to the currency you sent from (GBP), your bank converts your money when you pay, and uses its own exchange rate. This is not the Wise rate, and we have no control over it. It\u2019s likely to add an extra cost on top of your Wise fee. \n\n**Tip:** Always pay with a card that uses the same currency as the currency you\u2019re sending from. \n\n### You\u2019ve used a more expensive card \u2014 like a credit or corporate card\n\nHere\u2019s an example: imagine you set up your transfer on Wise. You choose to pay with your debit card, and we show you the fee upfront. But when you actually pay, you enter the details of your credit card.\n\nYour transfer will still go through. But because you paid with a different type of card, you might be charged differently. That\u2019s because in some countries, different cards have different fees on Wise. Generally, credit cards and corporate cards might be more expensive. If this happens, we\u2019ll send you a notification telling you how you\u2019ve been charged.\n\n**Tip:** We\u2019ll always show you our fees clearly and transparently \u2014 and it may be cheaper to use a consumer debit card.",

Just follow the directions above to do so. You may also see a different message for the this step, like \u201cYour money may still be in your bank account\u201d, or \u201cSorry, we didn\u2019t get the money yet\u201d. This is fine, you\u2019ll still be able to see the Cancel transfer button underneath the transfer.

You may be able to cancel the transfer by yourself if you can still see the Cancel transfer button. But, if you can\u2019t see it, you\u2019ll need to get in touch so we can cancel it. Our conversion process can be fast, so make sure to reach out as soon as possible. If we haven\u2019t sent out the money yet, we can refund it back to you. \n\n### Your money\u2019s been sent out\n\nOnce Wise sends out the money, unfortunately there\u2019s nothing we can do to refund it. If the recipient\u2019s details are wrong, their bank will usually reject it and send the money back to us. We\u2019ll get in touch with you if this happens to ask whether you\u2019d like to update the details and send it again, or cancel the transfer and get a refund. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made a mistake in the amount you sent, or you don\u2019t want to send the transfer anymore, your recipient will need to contact their bank and ask them to reject the payment. This means the money will be sent back to Wise, and we\u2019ll refund it back to you.\n\n### Your transfer\u2019s complete\n\nOnce a transfer has been sent to the recipient\u2019s account and is marked as complete, we can\u2019t cancel it.\n\nWe recommend you get in touch with the recipient and ask them to return the money to you, or, if the payment was to yourself, transfer it back. \n\nUnfortunately, Wise can\u2019t get involved in disputes between senders and recipients, so we recommend you know and trust the person or business you\u2019re sending to before you make a transfer.",

There are a few reasons why we might do this \u2014 here are some of the most common ones.\n\n### You didn\u2019t pay for the transfer\n\nIf you set up a transfer and don\u2019t pay for it within 2 weeks, we\u2019ll automatically cancel it. If you\u2019d still like to make that transfer, you can set up a new one.\n\nYou won\u2019t get the same rate as the original transfer you set up. This is because we only guarantee the rate for 24\u201348 hours, depending on the currency you send. So, if your transfer was cancelled for this reason, the original rate would have already expired.\n\n### We need more information from you\n\nFor some transfers we might need more information from you. If we do, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know what we need. If we don\u2019t hear from you in 2 working days, we\u2019ll automatically cancel and refund your transfer. So, every time you send a transfer with us, please keep an eye on your emails.\n\n### The recipient details are wrong\n\nIf you make a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details, most banks won\u2019t accept the payment. They\u2019ll send the money back to us, and we\u2019ll ask you whether you\u2019d like to edit the details, or cancel the transfer. If we don\u2019t hear from you in 2 working days, we\u2019ll cancel and refund the transfer. And if you edit the details and the payment fails again, we\u2019ll automatically cancel the transfer.\n\nPlease check your recipient\u2019s details carefully every time you make a transfer. Here\u2019s what to do if you made a mistake.\n\n### You didn\u2019t set up a transfer\n\nSometimes, people send us money without setting up a transfer first. This means we get your money, but don\u2019t know where to send it. If this happens and you have a balance in the currency you send us, we\u2019ll automatically add your money to that account. It\u2019ll show on your activity list as \u201cAutoCredit\u201d.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a balance, we\u2019ll refund your money and let you know by email. It\u2019ll show on your transaction list as \u201cAutoRefund\u201d.",

This way, businesses who need to pay USD invoices or send money to an account outside the US can do so without using their bank.\n\nUSD is sent to bank accounts outside the US via the SWIFT payment network. This is different than a regular Wise transfer and could take a day or 2 longer. It also costs a bit more because it goes through intermediary banks, but is still cheaper than more traditional methods of sending money overseas.\n\nIf you\u2019re sending USD to a bank account in Hong Kong, we\u2019ll pay out your USD locally through CHATS system.\n\n### How it works \n\n  1. **Set up your transfer.** You\u2019ll need to add a new recipient. \n\n  2. **Select the recipient bank account country.** Even though the account\u2019s in USD, choose the country you\u2019re sending money to. \n\n  3. **Add the account number and SWIFT code of the recipient\u2019s bank account.** Transferring to an email address isn\u2019t supported yet.\n\n  4.  **Pay for your transfer.** You can pay using any of the currencies we support, as well as USD.

The SWIFT network works essentially the same way. \n\nThe money will travel from one country to another, but to do that, there are often **correspondent banks** involved. These correspondent banks often charge their own fee.\n\nTo improve this, Wise covers the fee automatically if we predict that your payment might get charged. To predict these fees, we have built a **prediction tool** for the correspondent bank fees and speed, based on historical data. \n\nWhen we predict that no correspondent fees will be charged, we only charge a sending fee of 2.90 USD. When we predict that some fees will be charged, we charge 14 USD. This is in addition to the SWIFT fee.\n\nThis way, we make sure that you pay as little as possible, and that your recipient is receiving the right amount.\n\nCheck the list of countries you can send USD to\n\n### What about FFC payments?\n\nWe can\u2019t send For Further Credit (FFC) payments. FFC is a payment made to a beneficiary that is not final. This means you can't send money to a recipient who will then forward the money somewhere else. These transactions require a separate field for entering the actual final recipient, and we do not have that option.",

You can do this either:\n\n  * online, through your online banking\n\n  * over the phone, with your telephone banking\n\n  * or in person, at a bank branch.\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a step by step guide with a bit more detail. \n\n### 1\\. Set up your transfer on Wise\n\nSet up your transfer \u2014 choose how much you\u2019re sending, and enter your recipient\u2019s bank details.\n\n### 2\\. Choose bank transfer at the payment step\n\nWhen you get to the payment step, choose bank transfer. This will bring up Wise\u2019s bank account details, as well as a reference.

Leave your Wise account, and pay by bank transfer directly through your bank\n\n **Important** : To make sure that your transfer isn\u2019t delayed, please double check that: \n\n  * **The name on your bank account matches the name on your Wise account** \u2014 if the names don\u2019t match, we won\u2019t be able to process your transfer. We can\u2019t accept your deposit if you use someone else\u2019s bank account with power of attorney to fund your transfer.

This is a faster and easier way of making an online bank transfer. If you choose that option, you\u2019ll need to enter your online banking details, pick which account you\u2019d like to pay from, and click approve. And that\u2019s it \u2014 we do the rest. \n\n### 4\\. You\u2019re all done \u2014 wait for confirmation\n\nWe\u2019ll send you an email as soon as your money arrives in Wise\u2019s bank account.

This number helps us identify which payment is yours. You\u2019ll need to include the number in the reference field when setting up a payment from your bank account.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t include the reference number, your transfer might be delayed while we try to find your money. To help us find it, you\u2019ll need to upload a proof of payment document. Once you upload your proof, someone on our team will be in touch. \n\nLearn more about what to do if you didn\u2019t include your reference number\n\n### I sent the wrong amount\n\nWhen you set up a transfer, make sure to send us the correct amount of money. We\u2019ll show you exactly how much to send, along with the rest of our bank details.\n\nIf you sent us more than needed, we\u2019ll refund the excess once we\u2019ve completed the transfer.\n\nIf you sent us less than needed, we\u2019ll pause the transfer and email you to ask what you\u2019d like to do next.\n\nLearn more about what to do if you sent the wrong amount\n\n### My bank account name and Wise name don\u2019t match\n\nWhen you send us a payment, the name on the bank account where the money is coming from must match your name on Wise. The only exceptions are if you\u2019re paying from a joint account, or if you\u2019re paying as a business through your Wise Business account.\n\nIf someone else pays for your transfer, you\u2019ll need to cancel it. You can set it up again and pay for it from your own account.\n\nLearn more about sending from a different account here\n\n### I made a mistake with Wises\u2019 bank details\n\nWhen you\u2019re paying by bank transfer, always double check that the bank details you\u2019ve entered for Wise match the ones we show you in the bank transfer details screen. If you do make a mistake, the money will likely be rejected and come back to you.",

For most currencies, you can pay using your debit or credit card. \n\nWe only accept Visa, Mastercard, and some Maestro cards.

You can\u2019t pay for business payments from a personal bank account. \n\n### International card payments\n\nAn international card payment means you paid using a card not issued in the country you\u2019re paying with. For example, you paid EUR from your card that was issued in Canada. \n\nWhen you pay with an international card, you\u2019ll be charged more fees. We have to charge a higher fee because it costs us more to process them. And your bank might charge a fee to convert your money for you too. \n\nIf you\u2019re paying a currency from the EEA, using your EEA issued card, you won\u2019t be charged international card fees. \n\n### Unsuccessful card payments\n\nWhen your card payment fails, we\u2019ll show you an error message. Here are common reasons why a card payment might fail.\n\n### Cancelling your card payment\n\nIf you need to cancel a transfer that was paid for with your debit or credit card, find the transfer in the Activity section of your account, and select **Cancel transfer**. \n\nOnce cancelled, debit card refunds can take up to 10 working days to process, but are usually back in your account in 2\u20135 working days. You can only cancel uncompleted transactions.",

If an error message appears on your screen after you try to pay, or if we confirm your payment has not been successful, then you have not been charged.\n\n### Payment declined by your bank\n\nThe most common reason for an unsuccessful card payment is that your bank has declined it. This means they\u2019ve told Wise not to take the money. \n\nIt\u2019s normal for them to stop a payment that looks unusually large, or if it\u2019s to a new and unknown recipient \u2014 just in case. \n\nThe best way to fix this is to call your bank, let them know it\u2019s you making this payment and that Wise is a trusted recipient. Once they\u2019ve confirmed this, your next attempt should be successful.\n\n### 3D Secure verification issue\n\nSometimes your internet browser can be what\u2019s causing the problem with your 3D Secure verification. You can try following these browser solutions, and then make your payment again. \n\nIf you\u2019re still having issues with 3D Secure, call your bank to ask if there\u2019s an issue, and to make sure your card is 3D Secure.\n\nIf the issue persists, try making a bank transfer to us instead, or use a different card if you can.\n\n### Browser issues\n\nSome anti-virus or firewall software can affect your card payment. To fix this, make sure Wise is on the list of \"safe merchants\" on your anti-virus software. Check that any anti-virus or firewall software you have installed allows pop-ups.\n\n### Insufficient funds\n\nYour bank might stop your card payment if there isn\u2019t enough money in your account, or if you have a per-transaction limit. \n\nThough card limits vary from card to card and from bank to bank, limits in many southern European countries (France especially) can be as low as 300\u2013500 EUR.\n\nOther banks may treat card payments as cash withdrawals, meaning your cash withdrawal limit will apply.\n\nTo find out more or to adjust your limits, get in touch with your bank. It can take time for the changes to take effect, so try paying by bank transfer or setting up a smaller transfer in the meantime.\n\n### Payment declined by Wise\n\nWise sometimes stops card payments to protect our customers from potentially fraudulent activity. It could be because your card was issued in a country we don\u2019t currently support.\n\nIf this is the case, you\u2019ll need to pay another way. Try paying by bank transfer or using a different card.\n\n### Other\n\nMost of the time, card payments are declined for the reasons listed above. But if you see a more generic error message, the best way to fix it is to try paying another way.\n\nKeep in mind that we currently can\u2019t accept payments from:\n\n  * Payment cards not in your name or your business' name;\n\n  * US issued cards, if the address on your Wise account is outside the US;\n\n  * All cards issued in Argentina, China, and Nigeria;\n\n  * Business cards issued in Russia and Belarus;\n\n  * Prepaid cards from the UAE, or international payments from an AED currency card;\n\n  * Credit cards issued in Singapore;\n\n  * Any card when you're paying for MYR transfers or balance top ups;\n\n  * Any card if your address is in Turkey;\n\n  * American Express (AMEX) cards.",

They also take longer to pay for, because you need to send the money to us as a separate transaction. \n\nYou can do this using a manual bank transfer, or by using the money in your currency accounts. Both these methods are inexpensive to process, and we don't need to do extra work to speed up your transfer. As a result, we can offer Low cost transfers at a cheaper price.\n\nYou can also use Open Banking, a secure and convenient way to pay for GBP transfers. \n\nLearn more about Open Banking\n\n### Fast transfer\n\nThis type of transfer is the most convenient way to send money abroad with Wise. It\u2019s also faster to set up \u2014 you just need to type in your card details, or use Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n\nWhen you pay by card or mobile wallet, it costs us more to process your transaction. \n\n  * Your money isn't sent to us instantly \u2014 we need to do some extra work to speed it up.\n\n  * You get extra support from us to keep your money safe if you're unlucky enough to have your card used fraudulently.\n\n\n\n\nThese things make Fast transfers more expensive. But we don't make any more profit, it simply covers the extra costs associated with this type of transfer.\n\n### Advanced transfer\n\nThis type of transfer is for sending money from a GBP bank account that\u2019s not in the UK, a EUR bank account that\u2019s not in Europe, etc. Advanced transfers use the SWIFT payment network \u2014 and your bank will probably charge a fee for that.

If you don\u2019t hold a Wise balance in the currency you\u2019re planning to send money from, we\u2019ll open one for you. You\u2019ll use this account to see your money coming into Wise, and being sent to your recipient. \n\nIf you live in Singapore, you can only schedule transfers below 5,000 SGD and up to 30,000 SGD a year with your personal Wise account.\n\n **Quick tip:** if your transfer is time-sensitive, we recommend scheduling it at least 3 days in advance. Currently, you can only set up scheduled transfers on the website and Android mobile app. \n\n### How do I make a scheduled transfer? \n\n  1. Select **Send money**\n\n  2. Confirm where you're sending from (your balance, or an external account)\n\n  3. Enter the amount you\u2019d like to send\n\n  4. Select the calendar icon next to **Continue** to schedule your transfer\n\n  5. Choose the date you\u2019d like us to send your money\n\n  6. Choose the frequency (one-time, monthly, bi-weekly, weekly)\n\n  7. Select **Confirm**\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll remind you to make sure you have enough money in your balance, or bank account, for your transfer before your scheduled date.\n\n _Turn on notifications for updates about your transfer_\n\nYou can check the status, or cancel your scheduled transfer, by going to **Manage** and then **Scheduled Transfers** on the website, or by going to the **Manage** tab in your app.\n\n###  **Can I edit a scheduled transfer?**\n\nWe can't change the details of a scheduled transfer. If you need to make changes, please cancel the transfer and set up a new one with the correct details.\n\n### What happens to my transfer on the scheduled date?\n\n **If your transfer is scheduled for a holiday or non-working day**\n\nIt depends on the payment method you choose to pay with, and the country you're sending money to. For example:\n\n  * For transfers from USD or CAD \u2014 if you\u2019re paying by direct debit, we\u2019ll schedule the payment on the next working day.\n\n  * Most payments to GBP are instant, so we\u2019ll instantly send the transfer the moment we\u2019ve received your money. \n\n\n\n\n**If you schedule a monthly transfer on the 30th, and the upcoming month has less than 30 days**\n\nYour transfer will be sent on the last day of that month. \n\nFor example, if you schedule a monthly transfer on 30 January, but February only has 28 days \u2014 your transfer will be sent on the 28th.\n\n **If your scheduled transfer is sent directly from your balance**\n\nThe scheduled date of your transfer is the day we send the money to your recipient \u2014 not the day they receive it. \n\nYour recipient should get the money within 3 days from the scheduled date.\n\n **If your scheduled transfer is sent from your external bank account**\n\nThe scheduled date of your transfer is the day we pull money from your account \u2014 not the day your recipient receives it. \n\nIt usually takes 1-4 working days for your money to reach us. You will see the debit in your bank account usually within 2-3 working days of making the transfer. \n\n### Does my recurring transfer ever end?\n\nYour recurring transfer ends on the date you selected when you set it up. If you didn\u2019t set up an end date, you can cancel future transfers in **Manage** under the **Schedule transfer** section, or in the app under the **Manage** tab.\n\n **When can I cancel my scheduled transfer?**\n\nYou can cancel your transfer up to 23:59 the day before your transfer is scheduled.",

This can make it hard to send large amounts \u2014 but here are some ways to make it easier.\n\n### Go to your bank branch in person\n\nYou can send larger amounts in one go if you go to your bank in person, rather than doing it online or over the phone.\n\nIt\u2019s a good option if your bank is easy to get to, and you need to send money fast.\n\n### Call your bank to increase the limit\n\nSome banks let you increase your limits for a short amount of time, like 24 hours. Give your bank a call to see if they\u2019ll let you do this.\n\nThis is a good option if it\u2019s hard for you to get to your bank in person, and you need to send money fast. But not all banks do it.\n\n### Add several smaller amounts to your balance, over a few days\n\nTo do this, open a balance in your Wise account. Then, add money to it over several days and hold it in your balance. Once you\u2019ve added the full amount, go ahead and make your transfer. \n\n### Or, set up a transfer for the full amount and pay for it in several, smaller amounts\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer not to open a balance, you can still set up a normal transfer for the full amount \u2014 and pay for it in several smaller amounts. To do this, set up your transfer as usual. Then pay in the first of the several, smaller amounts. This will trigger an email asking if:\n\n  * you\u2019ve made a mistake \n\n  * if your bank has limits and you\u2019re paying for your transfer in several smaller amounts\n\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions in your email to tell us you\u2019ll be paying several smaller amounts. \n\nKeep in mind that if you pay for your transfer over several days, your guaranteed rate is likely to expire. This is because your rate is usually guaranteed for 24\u201348 hours, and we can only keep that rate if we get the full amount within that timeframe. \n\n**Tip:** The email you get at this stage is sent automatically \u2014 so it may be faster and smoother to arrange your transfer through this email, than it is to get in touch with us. \n\n**Reminder:** Always be sure to double check the specific currency you\u2019ll be paying with and sending to \u2014 some of our currencies have limits on how much you can send.",

So when you make a large transfer, we make things as easy as possible.\n\nHere are some tips to help you get started.\n\n* * *\n\n### Understand your banking limits, or pay in-branch\n\nYour bank might limit the amount of money you can send per day, or per transfer. Those limits might differ if you\u2019re sending online, over the phone, or in-branch. \n\nIf you\u2019re sending online or over the phone, your bank might limit the amount you can send in one go. That means you\u2019ll need to send several smaller transfers over the course of a few days instead \u2014 and you might miss out on the rate.\n\nYour bank might let you send a bigger amount if you go in-person, to your branch. So it\u2019s often quicker, and simpler, to set up larger transfers in-branch. You can download a PDF with all your transfer details to make this easier. \n\n**Tip: Contact your bank to find out your limits for sending money.\u200b**\n\n* * *\n\n### Verify your identity beforehand to avoid delays \n\nWhen you send money with Wise, we\u2019ll ask to verify your identity. We do this by checking your photo ID and address. It usually takes about 2 working days. \n\nIf you set up your transfer before getting verified, we\u2019ll do these checks before we send your money. So to avoid delays, get verified beforehand.\n\nAfter you pay for your transfer, we might need to see more documents. That\u2019s because when you send a large amount, we need to verify where the money came from. It could be a scan/screenshot of your bank statement, a property sale agreement, or a pay slip. \n\n**Tip:** **Get verified** **before making your first big transfer.**\n\n* * *\n\n### Send us proof of your joint account\n\nIf you\u2019re sending money from a joint account, send us proof that you\u2019re one of the account holders. It\u2019s quicker to do this before you set up your transfer.\n\nBy sharing proof that your account is in the same name used on your Wise account, and has the same account number as your transfer, you\u2019ll help us keep your transfer moving smoothly. \n\n**Tip:** **Send us** **a scan or screenshot of a recent bank statement with your name and account details.**\n\n* * *\n\n### Learn more\n\n  * How much it costs\n\n  * How we determine our fees\n\n  * Customer reviews\n\n\n\n\n **Need more help?** Get in touch with our team of large transfer experts.",

And the more you send with us, the more you save on fees.\n\n### How do our fees work? \n\nWhen you send over 100,000 GBP (or equivalent in your currency) over a calendar month, you\u2019ll get a lower fee on the amount you send over the limit.\n\nThe lower fee applies on one-time transfers or multiple completed transfers in the same month. This discount will only apply when a conversion happens (i.e. GBP to EUR). And it doesn\u2019t matter how many currencies you send to and from \u2014 you can still get the lower fee.\n\nIt would not apply if you are sending transfers to same currencies (i.e. USD to USD externally or USD to your Wise USD currency account).\n\n### How much is the fee?\n\nThe more you send, the lower your fee is. This table shows the estimated percentage discount depending on your monthly volume.\n\n\n--- CSV table begins ---  \nVolume (GBP),Discount (%)  \n0\u2013100k,0  \n100k\u2013300k,0.1  \n300k\u2013500k,0.15  \n500k\u20131m,0.16  \n1m+,0.17  \n--- CSV table ends ---  \n\n\nThis works a bit like tax brackets. So, just like you pay no tax on the first part of your income, then a progressively higher percentage on the next part of your income \u2014 you only get the lower fee on the amount that falls in each bracket. \n\nThe thresholds are calculated in GBP. So, if you normally send USD or any other currency, we\u2019ll work out whether you\u2019re in the bracket to get a lower fee using the live exchange rate. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to work the fee out yourself. We\u2019ll always automatically apply it to your transfer. \n\n**An example of how the fee works**\n\nLet\u2019s say that in January, you send 2 transfers of 100,000 GBP to EUR, and 1 transfer of 500 GBP to EUR.\n\nOn the first transfer, we\u2019ll charge our normal fee for sending GBP to EUR by bank transfer, which is 0.41%. There\u2019s no discount on it, because it\u2019s the limit for the first bracket of 100,000 GBP.\n\nOn the second and third transfers, we\u2019ll charge 0.31%, because you\u2019re in the second bracket and now qualify for the lower fee. So even when you\u2019re sending smaller amounts in January, you\u2019ll get the lower fee as long as the initial limits for each bracket have been met.\n\nOver the course of the month, that\u2019s an average fee of 0.36% for this example. \n\nIf you send that 200,500 GBP in one go instead of in 3 transfers, you\u2019ll get the same average fee of 0.36%.\n\n> It will be calculated as follows:\n> \n> 1\\. 100,000 GBP * 0.41% = 410 GBP\n> \n> 2\\. 100,500 GBP * 0.31% = 311.55 GBP\n> \n> Total = 721.80 GBP for the fees.\n\nNote: You might see a lesser fee, do not worry! This is because we try to pass on additional savings we can find for our customers.\n\n **Remember:** a transfer needs to be completed \u2014 that is, sent out to the recipient \u2014 before it'll count towards your threshold. If we look at our example again, that means if you only _set up_ that first transfer of 100,000 GBP for January, you wouldn't get the lower fee for the next 100,000 GBP in February. \n\nYou can calculate your average fee here.\n\nLearn more about sending large amounts with Wise\n\nThis article was last updated in February 2022. _For the most up to date information on your fees, please see the_ _ _Terms of Use__ _for your region._ _For the most up to date information on your fees, please see the_ _Terms of Use_ _for your region._",

We offer guaranteed rates for all of our transfers. \n\nAs you finish setting up your transfer, we\u2019ll guarantee your rate for a certain period of time. It\u2019s important that you send your money to us right away so we receive your money on time. As long as we receive your money on time, you\u2019ll get that rate locked.\n\nIf your money doesn\u2019t reach us in time, we\u2019ll still convert and send it as soon as possible. But we\u2019ll use the mid-market rate instead.\n\nLearn more about what happens if you miss the guaranteed rate\n\n### How long is the rate guaranteed on my transfer?\n\nWe guarantee your rate long enough for your money to get to us. It depends on the currency you\u2019re sending from. We\u2019ll always tell you how long the rate is guaranteed for when you set your transfer up.\n\n###  **What if the rate changes significantly in that time, or the rate is unstable?**\n\nFor any transfer with a guaranteed rate, there's a 5% rate limit. If the rate **changes by 5% or more** during the guaranteed rate period, we may cancel and refund your transfer. We\u2019ll send the money back to the account it came from. \n\nSometimes, markets can be volatile. This means we may need to set temporary limits on the amount of money you can send with the guaranteed rate, even if the movement is under 5%. You'll see a notification for this when trying to send over the limit.\n\nWhen adding money to your balance from a different currency, just add the same currency first, and convert it to the one you want to send. This ensures we give you the best rate at the time.\n\n### What if my transfer falls on a weekend?\n\nIn most countries, banks don\u2019t process transfers over the weekend \u2014 they start paying them out on the following working day. Because of this, we usually don\u2019t count the weekend when we calculate guaranteed rates. For example, if your transfer has a 48-hour guaranteed rate, and you set up your transfer on Friday, at 5:00pm, your rate will be guaranteed until Tuesday at 5:00 pm. \n\nIf we do guarantee your rate over the weekend, you\u2019ll see this when you set your transfer up. \n\nNote: weekends in some countries, such as the UAE, are Friday and Saturday. In this case, we\u2019d send out your money on the Sunday.\n\n### What rate do I get if I set up a transfer on the weekend?\n\nBecause the market closes on a Friday, we don\u2019t give new rates over the weekend. So, if you set up a transfer on a weekend, you\u2019ll get the last rate before the market closed on the Friday. \n\nWe stop getting live rates at 5pm New York time, and we start getting live rates again at 9am Auckland time. \n\n### How many transfers can I set up with a guaranteed rate?\n\nYou can\u2019t set up an unlimited number of transfers with a guaranteed rate. And you should only set up a transfer if you intend to complete it. We\u2019ll limit the number of guaranteed rate transfers you can make if we notice you\u2019re setting up multiple ones to get the best rate.\n\nIf you created multiple transfers but only paid for one of them, we\u2019ll assign your deposit to the first transfer you created. You can cancel any transfer you don\u2019t intend to complete and leave just one active, so we know where to assign your money to.\n\nKeep in mind that if you remain at one step of the transfer setup process for more than 30 minutes, the guaranteed rate will refresh.\n\n### What if the rate changes significantly?\n\nWhen you create a transfer with a guaranteed rate, you\u2019re subject to a rate limit of 5%. So if the rate changes by 5% or more during the time we guarantee your rate for, we reserve the right to cancel and refund your transfer. If that happens, we\u2019ll send the money back to the account it came from.",

We don\u2019t accept driver\u2019s licence (including foreign and NZ driver\u2019s licence) or Kiwi Access Card as identity documents.\n\n **Sending from JPY**\n\nYour ID must be issued by Japan and we\u2019ll also ask for your My Number document. \n\n**Sending from BRL**\n\nYour ID must be issued by the Brazilian government. You can also verify your identity with a national identity (RG) card. \n\n### If you\u2019re a refugee, you may be able to use Wise\n\nWe know that it\u2019s hard for people with refugee status to open a bank account. But if you originate from, or have settled in any of the countries below, we can verify you with the following documents: \n\n**The US**\n\n  * Passport photo page\n\n  * State identification card or driver\u2019s license\n\n  * Permanent resident card (also called a green card)\n\n  * Form I-766 Employment Authorization Document (EAD), also called a work permit\n\n\n\n\n **Tip:** We can\u2019t accept green cards or work permits if your address is in Nevada, Hawaii, the Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands.\n\n **Canada**\n\n  * Passport\n\n  * Canadian refugee travel document\n\n  * Permanent resident card\n\n\n\n\n **A country in the EU or EEA**\n\n  * Alien\u2019s passport photo page\n\n  * Travel document\n\n  * ID from an EEA member country, like a passport or ID card, that states your refugee status\n\n\n\n\n **Tip:** If you\u2019re a stateless person, the NY Convention of 28th September 1954 gives you the legal right to an alien\u2019s passport. And under the Geneva Convention of 28th July, 1951, you have the right to a travel document. \n\n### What if my ID isn't listed in this article?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any of the documents above, we won\u2019t be able to verify you.

But if we can\u2019t read what\u2019s on a document, we have to reject it.\n\n### When making a copy of a document, here\u2019s what to check:\n\n **Lighting**\n\nIf it\u2019s too bright, glare might make part of your document unreadable. This can be a problem with laminated passport photo pages or driving licences.\n\n **Your fingers**\n\nIf you\u2019re holding up a document for a photo, it\u2019s easy to cover up some details with your fingers. Try taking the photo with the document on a flat surface. \n\n**The camera frame**\n\nWe need to see the whole document, as this helps us confirm its authenticity. So try to fit the whole document in the shot.\n\n **Blur and camera grain**\n\nIf you\u2019re on the move, your camera might not be able to focus on the details printed on your document. Try taking the photo with the document on a flat surface. \n\n**Tip:** Be careful of zoom mode, or bad lighting. It can result in photos that are too grainy for us to read properly. \n\n**We can\u2019t accept copies of photocopies**\n\nWe need to be sure that you have the document you\u2019re verifying your identity with. So it\u2019s best to take a new photo when you\u2019re going through verification. \n\n**Using a camera is better than a scanner**\n\nMany scanners aren\u2019t great at scanning IDs and passports because they\u2019re too thick and stop the lid from closing. So the resulting scans are close to unreadable. Again, it\u2019s best to take a photo if you can. \n\n### Are you sending us the right documents? \n\nIf you need to verify your identity, we\u2019ll ask for a copy of your driver\u2019s licence, national ID card, or passport photo page. There are some exceptions, depending on where you\u2019re sending from. \n\n**Tip:** We can\u2019t use selfies or bank cards to verify your identity. But sometimes we\u2019ll ask you to take a photo of yourself holding your ID next to your face. \n\n### Have you sent us a new document?\n\nUsually, we need 1\u20132 working days to review new documents. But if you had to upload a lot of documents, it may take us a little longer. Keep an eye on your inbox, as we\u2019ll confirm that you\u2019re verified by email. \n\nWhen you\u2019re verified, we\u2019ll automatically resume any transfers you have going through.

It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone\u2019s money safe. \n\nSo depending on where you\u2019re sending money from, and how much you send, we\u2019ll ask you to verify your identity. This helps us keep your money safe.\n\nIf you have a Wise Business account, we also need to verify information about your business.\n\nFind out more about business verification\n\n* * *\n\n### How does verification work?\n\nWe usually verify your identity with some photo ID, proof of address, and/or a picture of you holding your ID.\n\nWhen and how we verify you depends on a few things:\n\n  *  **The amount you send**\n\n    * When you send larger amounts, we might need to see additional documents that show how you got the money.\n\n    * When you send smaller amounts, we\u2019ll usually verify your identity.\n\n  *  **The currency you send**\n\n    * Some countries require proof of identity to send any amount.\n\n    * Some currencies require further identification. For example, sending US dollars requires an online banking log in.\n\n    * Some countries and currencies require more information about how you earn your money, and how you plan to use Wise. If we need this, we\u2019ll ask you when you set up your transfer.\n\n  *  **How many transfers you\u2019ve made**\n\n    * While we might only verify your identity at first, we might need to verify your address later on.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, we need to ask for additional documents once a transfer has started. Rest assured our team will work tirelessly to verify these documents as soon as possible to get your money moving again.\n\nOther times, we can automatically verify you when you make a bank transfer. If your transfer comes from your own bank account, and your name there matches with the name on your Wise account, we consider this a first form of identity confirmation. You may not need to do ID or address verification in this situation. \n\nWe can only do this for some currencies, and if you send below 15,000 EUR. We can\u2019t do this for business accounts, either. \n\n* * *\n\n### What types of documents does Wise accept?\n\nEverything on the document you share should match the information on your Wise account. \n\nMake sure the photo isn\u2019t blurry or covered, so we can see all the info. If there\u2019s information on the back of your document, we\u2019ll need to see that, too. \n\nMake sure the document isn\u2019t in Arabic, Aramaic, Azerbaijani, Hebrew or Urdu text \u2014 we don\u2019t have the resources to support these. \n\n**A** **valid ID** **can be:**\n\n  * Passport (photo page only)\n\n  * National ID card (we only accept the most recent version of the Nigerian national ID card)\n\n  * Photo driving licence (there are some _exceptions_)\n\n\n\n\n **A valid** **proof of address document** **can be:**\n\n  * Utility bills: gas, electric, or landline phone (no mobile phone bills)\n\n  * A bank or credit card statement (photo/scan of a physical letter or PDF of statement)\n\n  * A council tax bill, or a HMRC notification\n\n  * Vehicle registration or tax\n\n  * Photo driving licence showing your address and expiry date\n\n  * Any other government or financial institution-issued document\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n### How does live ID + Selfie verification work?\n\nIn some cases you may be asked to capture a picture of your ID and a selfie to help verify you. In some special cases, you may be asked to upload a picture of yourself (a selfie) while holding your ID. Find out more about selfie verification.\n\n* * *\n\n### How long does verification take?\n\nIf we ask to verify you while setting up a transfer, we\u2019ll start reviewing your documents once we have received the money for the transfer. From there we\u2019ll work to get it done within 2\u20133 working days. When successfully verified, we\u2019ll automatically resume your transfer, and let you know by email.",

We need to see the full document photo page.\n\n  * It may be expired. Please check that your document is still valid before you upload it.\n\n  * Your details may not match. Please check that you have entered your name and date of birth correctly on the website.\n\n  * We may also need to see the back of the document. If there is information on both sides, please make sure you upload both for us.\n\n  * It may be a document type that we can\u2019t accept.\n\n  * It may be in a format we can\u2019t accept, like a PDF.\n\n\n\n\n **If you haven\u2019t heard from our team within 5 working days:**\n\nCheck that you\u2019ve set up and paid for your transfer \u2014 we can\u2019t start verifying you until we get this.\n\nWe\u2019ll email you once we\u2019ve verified you.

It allows people and businesses paying to a recipient in the UK to check whether the name they have entered matches the one on the recipient\u2019s account. \n\nIt helps make sure that people are sending money to the correct account. It\u2019s part of a greater effort by _UK institutions_ and the _finance industry_ to tackle scams and fraud.\n\nConfirmation of Payee currently only supports payments to UK local account details (Sort Code and Account Number) via CHAPS, Faster Payments or a Standing Order upon set up. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t support BACS and Direct Debits. \n\n### How it works\n\nWhen you set up a new recipient, the receiving bank checks the name on their bank account. You will be shown one of these outcomes:\n\n  *  **Full match** : The name completely matches with the name on the Wise account\n\n  *  **Partial match:** The name partially matches, but it\u2019s a close match \u2014 for example you entered Mick Jager instead of Mick Jagger\n\n  *  **No match:** The name doesn\u2019t match with the name on the recipient account.\n\n  *  **Confirmation of Payee Unavailable:** The name can\u2019t be checked \u2014 for example, if an account doesn't exist or the receiving bank doesn\u2019t participate in Confirmation of Payee\n\n\n\n\n###  **What you should know**\n\nWhen you are setting up a new UK recipient, we\u2019ll tell you if the name you entered matches the one listed for the account details. We will also let you know if we haven\u2019t been able to check the name. \n\nIn both cases, you should double check whether you are sending money to the correct person or business before completing the payment. \n\nIf you decide to continue without receiving confirmation of the name being correct, we may not be able to recover your money if it ends up in the wrong account.\n\n### Future plans for CoP\n\nWe\u2019re also working to support checking the names of recipients you set up on your Wise account. In the coming months, when you set up a new GBP recipient, we\u2019ll let you know whether the name you entered matches the one on the receiving bank account.\n\n### How to opt out of CoP\n\nIf you\u2019d like to opt your Wise account out of Confirmation of Payee, send an email to _confirmationofpayee@wise.com_ explaining why. \n\nWe aim to review your request within 7 days. If we deny your request, we\u2019ll let you know why. You can appeal a rejection by writing to the same email.\n\n### How to make a complaint\n\nIf you\u2019d like to issue a complaint to Wise about a transaction involving CoP \u2014 read more about the process.",

That means in some countries we might be required to:\n\n  * withhold on currency transfers,\n\n  * give customers an invoice for their remittance,\n\n  * report customer data to the local tax authorities. \n\n\n\n\nWe try to be as transparent as possible about any tax we're required to withhold, and any information of yours we're required to report, however we're not authorised to provide you with any tax advice.\n\n###  **What information do you report to tax authorities?**\n\nThe answer to this changes based on which country you\u2019re in. Certain Wise entities must comply with the global anti-tax evasion regimes, FATCA and CRS, due to the type of products they offer. \n\nFor example, our newest product, Assets, causes a subsidiary of Wise, TINV Ltd., which provides the Assets product to fall within the scope of FATCA and CRS as a Custodial Institution. Customers that participate in Assets who are deemed to be reportable persons will be reported to HMRC in line with the Automatic Exchange of Information. \n\nWise Australia Pty Ltd, another subsidiary of Wise, is also subject to FATCA and CRS due to the Authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) licence it holds. \n\nWise is working directly with the Electronic Money Association (EMA) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) to ensure our processes and products combat any tax evasion. As and when Wise is obligated to collect and report customer tax and financial information to tax authorities we will do so. \n\nIn addition to tax requirements, other regulations may require Wise to collect certain data, like transactions over a certain threshold, and report it to regulatory bodies. Our Terms and Conditions of each entity provide more information about the what we may need to report to different tax authorities. \n\n### **Who do I have to report my taxes to?**\n\nCustomers are required to disclose and pay any necessary taxes associated with transfers made through our systems, or on cash received into their Wise Account. \n\nThe triggering of a tax liability and/or reporting obligation will depend on your tax residency, the nature of the income, and potentially the amount. We recommend you seek tax advice if you're unclear on the tax implications of a specific transaction.\n\n###  **Does Wise charge any taxes?**\n\nWise may have to levy tax on its transfer fee according to local tax laws. For example Brazilian real (BRL) transactions where IOF (Imposto sobre Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Financeiras \u2014 financial operations tax) may be imposed. Where transactional taxes apply, these will either be included in the fee payable or shown separately at the time of payment, and won\u2019t impact the amount sent to the recipient.\n\nWise will pay out the agreed amount to the recipient and, if required to withhold any taxes, will disclose any taxes that will apply. Depending on the nature of a transfer, you or the recipient may need to declare and pay tax. Wise can\u2019t advise whether tax applies to your transfer and we recommend that you ask a financial advisor and/or the relevant tax authority",

And Customer Support doesn\u2019t have the ability to view the reasons why.\n\n **We can choose to close an account if we think:**\n\n  * it\u2019s a duplicate of another (you can only have one Wise account, unless we agree otherwise)\n\n  * its security has been compromised\n\n  * there are transactions on your account that we can\u2019t complete\n\n\n\n\nThese are just examples, though. You can find more reasons in our Terms of Use, where we explain how we\u2019re allowed to close accounts. \n\nWise never takes deactivations lightly, and they are handled with utmost attention and consideration. We fully understand that the deactivation can cause inconvenience to you and we're committed to going through this transition as smoothly as possible.\n\n### Pending payments\n\nWhen we deactivate your account, we cancel all pending payments. After reviewing your account, we\u2019ll work on returning any money that you\u2019ve already sent, the way we received it.\n\nRefund time depends on how you paid for your transfer:\n\n  *  **by card:** 3\u201310 working days\n\n  *  **by bank/wire transfer:** 2\u20133 working days\n\n  *  **by bank debit/ACH:** up to 90 working days, while we carry out due diligence checks\n\n\n\n\n### Remaining balances\n\nIf you still have money in your Wise Balances when we close your account, we\u2019ll work on sending it back to your bank account. But first, we need to carry out due diligence checks. While we do that, your money and information will be safe and secure. \n\nTo request the funds to be refunded back to you \u2014 submit a refund request.\n\n###  **Balance statements**\n\nAfter deactivation, you're not able to access your account information, however if you need balance statements for tax purposes or other reason, please contact our support here.\n\n###  **What can I do next?**\n\nIf you\u2019re not happy with our decision to close your account, you can appeal it. During the appeal, you may be asked for more information and bank account details outside of Wise (to an external bank account) where to refund your money from the balances. The time it takes to review your appeal may vary, but we'll do our best to inform you of the status and timeline.\n\nLearn how to make an appeal\n\nAdditionally, you have the right to ask for a review of your case by lodging a complaint. \n\nDuring a complaint review, we'll assess the quality of the service and support you have received. We can also assess if we've honoured our agreements with you, like the Customer Agreement.\n\nA complaint review does not include or affect re-assessing deactivation, or speeding up refunds and any part of the due diligence process. These will be dealt with in the appeal process. \n\nCommonly, a complaint should be reviewed within 14 calendar days, but can take longer depending on where we offer our services to you.\n\n _Read more about the complaint process here._",

Banks do. This is why governments make them insure their deposits by participating in country-specific deposit insurance schemes like the FSCS and FDIC.\n\nBecause we\u2019re not lending your money we handle it differently, by safeguarding it. Safeguarding means that we look after your money, keep it separate from our own money, and keep it available to you whenever you need it. \n\nHow we hold your money can vary by country. Learn more about how Wise safeguards:\n\n  * UK customer funds\n\n  * EEA customer funds \n\n  * US customer funds\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about where we\u2019re regulated\n\n###  **How we keep your money available to you even during market turmoil**\n\nWe make sure your money is safe and readily available to you. Roughly 60% of your money is in secure liquid assets such as UK and US Government bonds and money market funds (as of 13 March 2023). The other 40% is in cash in reputable banks. For a government bond to fail, the government would need to default on their loan payments, which almost never happens with stable governments. For the money that we put into banks, we hold it with several reputable banks with strong liquidity. \n\nThe bonds we hold are predominantly short-term bonds so we are not materially exposed, and therefore more resilient, to increasing interest rates. The average duration of the bonds we hold is currently under 6 months \u2013 with the majority of bonds having a remaining term of 3 months or less.\n\n###  **Keep growing your money with Interest**\n\nIf you live in the UK or EEA, we give you the opportunity to grow your money \u2014 following central bank rates \u2014 when you switch it to Interest, through Wise Assets. \n\nWhen you switch, your money\u2019s in a fund holding government-guaranteed assets. However, an investment is never guaranteed and it\u2019s possible that the value of your money could decrease, for example if interest rates become negative.\n\nLearn more about Assets\n\nIf you\u2019ve already switched to Interest, learn how your money is held\n\nIf you live in the US, you might be eligible to earn interest on the money you hold with us.\n\nGet started by opening your personal or business account.",

This includes all the money you hold across all currencies in your Wise Balances and Jars. This applies to both personal and business accounts. \n\n### **How do I know if I'm a Japanese user?**\n\nYou are a Japanese user if you have registered with a Japanese address in your Wise account. \n\nIf the registered address of your personal account is different from your business account, only the account which has a registered address in Japan will be subject to the holding limits. \n\n### **How does Wise calculate my holding balance?**\n\nIf you\u2019re holding money in other currencies, we'll use the mid-market rate to convert all your non-JPY balances to JPY to determine your total balance in JPY. For example: If you have 500,000 JPY and 5,000 USD . And the exchange rate is 1 USD = 135 JPY. This means your USD is 675,000 in JPY. So in total, you\u2019re holding 500,000 + 675,000 = 1,175,000 JPY. As the holding limit set is 1 million JPY, you will be 175,000 JPY over the limit.\n\n###  **How do I remain within the holding limit?**\n\nWe know that from time to time, you may receive or hold more than 1 million JPY at a time. So to remain compliant \u2014 while giving you control of your money \u2014 you\u2019ll have 30 days to withdraw the extra amount. Within the 30 days, you will need to set up an external account. This is a bank account, where Wise automatically sends your excess funds to, in case your balance exceeds 1 million JPY. If we need to convert your funds to send your excess funds out, we will apply the _usual fees_. If you don't have an external account set up and you still have excess funds at the end of 30 days, we\u2019ll have to restrict your account to remain compliant.

Alternatively, you may manually transfer the excess funds out by sending out the money from your balance.

Because the rules are different depending on where you live, it\u2019s worth checking your local tax authority\u2019s website to understand what you need to do.\n\n###  **Assets and taxes in Austria**\n\nThis high-level guide is not a substitute for any consulting of your tax advisor. Wise can\u2019t give you advice on your personal tax situation. \n\n#### **What taxes do I need to pay?**\n\nIf you\u2019re a tax resident in Austria, you may need to pay income tax depending on your income from the fund and from selling/redeeming shares in the fund at a flat rate of 27.5%.\n\nIn Austria, investment funds are considered transparent for tax purposes, regardless of the fund\u2019s domicile.\n\nYou may not only pay tax on distributions from your shares in the fund, but also on realised gains on what wasn't distributed \u2014 like retained income or distribution-equivalent income. This may include dividends, interest, or capital gains on the level of the fund that weren\u2019t distributed. Unrealised gains on the level of the fund will be taxed when you sell or redeem your shares in the fund \u2014 so keep track of your acquisition costs for tax purposes.\n\nThe amount of the yearly taxable gains depends on if the fund is reporting tax data to the Austrian notification office, the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank AG \u2013 OeKB.\n\nLearn if the fund you\u2019re investing in is a reporting fund on OeKB\n\n **Reporting fund**\n\nYou\u2019ll find the relevant tax data per share for distributions and distribution-equivalent income in the tax report published on the OeKB web. This report also includes the amount to adjust your acquisition costs. \n\nWhen selling or redeeming shares in the fund, the difference between the adjusted acquisition costs and the proceeds is taken as tax base.\n\n **Non-reporting fund**\n\nDistributions are fully taxable. Distribution-equivalent income is taxed on a flat basis \u2014 the estimated tax base amounts the higher of 10% of the net-asset-value (NAV) per share by the end of the relevant year, or 90% of the difference between the first and the last NAV in the year. \n\nThis tax base is relevant when adjusting your acquisition costs. When selling or redeeming shares in the fund, the difference between the adjusted acquisition costs and the proceeds is taken as tax base.\n\nIn general, the tax rate for capital income is 27.5 % flat tax. Losses may be offset against certain capital income in the same year, but not carried forward.\n\nCapital income can be dividends, interest, distributions, distribution-equivalent income, and capital gains from the sale or redemption of shares.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an account with an Austrian bank withholding the income tax, you\u2019ll need to report your income from the fund for every tax year in your annual income tax return. \n\nLearn how to submit your tax return to the Austrian Tax Office (\u201cFinanzamt\u201d) on the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance\n\nWise can\u2019t give you tax advice.

Go to the **Account** section\n\n  2. Select **Statements**\n\n  3. Select **Stocks tax report**\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, these reports just give information about your gains and losses, and any combined buy or sell orders we make when you add or spend money. We plan to improve this report in future to give you a total annual gain or loss number and make tax reporting easier. \n\n#### The following items are important to consider\n\n **Realised gain/loss**\n\nAs an Estonian tax resident, you only have to report the amount of realised gains, i.e. gains derived upon actually selling the shares of the fund you have chosen. You should also report your losses as those will reduce the total amount of annual gains that are going to be taxed. If your losses exceed gains, you can carry forward the excessive losses to next years and offset against future gains. Unrealised gains which reflect the change of the market value of the shares you own but haven\u2019t sold, are not taxable. \n\n**Dividends**\n\nIf you receive dividends, you should pay attention on whether any income tax has already been withheld on those or not. If no income tax has been withheld, you should report them on your annual income tax return and pay 20% income tax. If income tax has been withheld at source, you still have to report your income but you do not have to pay any tax in Estonia. \n\n**Interest**\n\nIf you receive interest, you should also pay attention on withholding tax. If no tax has been withheld at source, you should pay 20% income tax in Estonia. If there is a withholding tax (usually 10-15%), you can credit this against your Estonian tax.",

If the amount of capital gains or capital income of the investor exceeds 30,000 EUR annually, the exceeding amount is taxed at the current rate of 34%.\n\nCapital losses on the fund sale shares are deducted from capital gains during the realisation year. If there are no capital gains, or if the income is lower than the capital losses that need to be deducted, the deduction will be done from the capital income of the investor. If there\u2019s no capital income during the realisation year, the loss is carried over to the following 5 years.\n\n **Application of the FIFO principle**\n\nFIFO (First In \u2013 First Out) principle is applied to the sale of the fund shares. Under FIFO, fund shares purchased first will be disposed of first. The purchase prices of the sold shares will be deducted from the sales prices in the same order as the shares were acquired.\n\n **The tax on the profit share of a foreign investment fund is credited in Finland**\n\nWhen invested in a foreign fund, the country of the fund may levy taxes on the profit paid for the profit shares of the fund. This is usually due to the profit share being equated with dividend income in the country in question. In such cases, the tax is credited against the paid Finnish taxes. The investor needs to claim for this credit.\n\n **Reporting via tax return**\n\nThe investor is liable to report the income or loss and the holdings to the Finnish Tax Administration on the annual tax return.\n\n **Sole trader**\n\nThe taxation depends on if the fund shares are part of the business assets of the sole trader. If they\u2019re not a part of the business assets, the income related to the shares is taxed for other private individuals.\n\n###  **Assets and taxes in France**\n\nA French tax resident will be liable to pay capital gains tax on any realised gains on investments in a fund. This means that capital gains tax is not due until the fund units have been sold, exchanged, or transferred in any other way. The gain on the fund units is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the acquisition price. Any incidental costs of sale may be included in the calculation price.\n\nCapital gains in France are subject to CGT tax at a flat rate of 12.8%. This could be increased to 19% if the fund is mainly composed of real estate assets, and if the CG exceeds 50,000 EUR then additional surtax may apply.

Box 3 of the Dutch personal income tax category taxes income from savings and investments. Earnings from bank cash deposits and stocks using Assets are likely to be taxed in box 3. No separate capital gains tax is due.\n\nIncome reported in box 3 is taxed at a flat rate of 31% based on an annual deemed return on investment. The deemed return is calculated based on the fair market value on 1 January of the financial year of all assets minus liabilities \u2014 \u201cnet assets\u201d\u2014 that are taxed in box 3. The first 50,650 EUR of net assets is exempt from tax (101,300 EUR for tax partners). With respect to foreign dividend income, foreign withholding taxes are partly deductible.\n\nActual earnings from Assets, such as capital gains and dividends, aren't taxed. Only the deemed income in box 3 is taxed, whether or not your actual earnings exceed the deemed return. The deemed return in box 3 increases based on the total value of net assets in box 3.\n\n **Changes to box 3**\n\nIn December 2021, the Dutch supreme court ruled that the current box 3 taxation system is unlawful and not in line with EU law. So the tax system will change to a system that taxes the actual annual return on investments, with the change likely to take effect from 2025.\n\nDuring the transition period, the box 3 taxation will be changed by allocating the deemed return into 3 classes: **savings** , **other investments** and **liabilities**. Each class is supposed to generate a deemed return/cost which will generate a total deemed income. Please note it currently remains unclear how the temporary system and the future system will work out exactly.\n\n **Reporting your box 3 income**\n\nYou\u2019ll need to submit a Dutch personal income tax return for the relevant financial year with the Dutch tax authorities. The fair market value on 1 January of most box 3 assets must be reported to the Dutch tax authorities by financial institutions within the EU, such as Wise.com and banks. \n\nThe needed information should already have been included in your pre-completed tax return. The fund manager BlackRock will publish it between April and September each year. We\u2019ll share it with you, and you\u2019ll need to check or include it when you report your tax.\n\n## Assets and taxes in Norway\n\nIf you're a tax resident in Norway, you must report both income (distributions and any capital gains) as well wealth (the tax value of units owned) as part of your annual income tax return. As Wise doesn't report tax details directly to Norwegian tax authorities, the relevant tax data won't form part of your pre-completed tax return. The taxation of income will depend on the type of fund that you own and the proportion of equity/fixed income of the fund.\n\nCapital gains (and losses) related to shares don't form part of the business income for a sole trader and is taxed similar to that of an individual.\n\nFor more information, see this guidance from the Norwegian tax authority.",

This means that capital gains tax isn't due until the fund units have been sold, exchanged, or otherwise transferred. The gains on the fund units are calculated as the difference between the selling price and the acquisition price including any cost of the sale. The current tax rate levied on capital gains is 30 percent.\n\nTax is also due on a standard income amount calculated on the basis of the invested capital in a fund. The capital base that is subject to taxation is the invested amount at the beginning of the calendar year. The standard income is then 0.4 percent of the capital base. The standard income amount that should be reported in the tax return is then taxed at a tax rate of 30 percent. This means that the effective tax rate is 0.12 percent of the amount invested at the beginning of the year. The standard income amount should be calculated using the value of the assets, in SEK, as of January 1.\n\nFinally, distributions from a fund that are provided in the form of cash or new units in the fund are taxed when the distribution is received by the individual. Distribution of new shares is recognized at the market value of the shares on the date of the distribution. The applicable tax rate is 30 percent of the distributed value.\n\nAll taxes in Sweden will be levied in Swedish krona (SEK).

If you add or receive money, we'll invest it in the fund we\u2019ve chosen\n\n  2. If you spend, or send, money we'll sell some of your investment\n\n  3. You can only take out up to *97% of your Balance or Jar\n\n\n\n\nWe handle the investment transactions behind the scenes \u2014 by buying or selling **units** in the fund.\n\n### Understanding units\n\nIf you think of the fund as a cake, a unit is a slice of that cake. The price of a unit can go up or down daily, depending on how the fund performs.\n\nIf you buy units and their price goes up, your investment has grown. And you\u2019ll get more money than you started with if you choose to sell at that price. \n\nBut if their price goes down, your investment is worth less. So you\u2019ll have less money than you started with if you choose to sell at that price.\n\n### Adding or receiving money\n\nWhenever you add or receive money, we\u2019ll buy units worth the same cash value.\n\nWe buy units once every working day, at the trading cut-off time \u2014 which is 07:00 UK time. If you add money after that, we\u2019ll buy units on the next working day at the cut-off time.\n\nIt can take up to 2 working days to complete a buy order for your units. When we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll update the total and available amounts in your Balance or Jar based on the total value of the units you hold.\n\n **Tip:** If you don\u2019t want to invest money that\u2019s been recently added, just make sure to withdraw it before the next cut-off time. \n\n### Taking money out\n\nYou can instantly access up to *97% of your Balance or Jar at any time.\n\nYou can do this in 3 ways:\n\n  * Spending money from your Balance, using your Wise card\n\n  * Sending money from your Balance\n\n  * Moving money out into a different Balance or Jar\n\n\n\n\nWhen you take money out, we\u2019ll sell units worth the same cash value at the next trading cut-off time \u2014 which is 07:00 UK time. This sale covers the cost of your transaction. You\u2019ll see the total and available amounts in your Balance or Jar change to reflect this.\n\nIt can take up to 2 working days to complete a sale. When we\u2019re done, you might see the amounts in your Balance or Jar change slightly. This is because the price of units can go up or down while the sale is being processed.\n\nWe only buy or sell units once per day. If you\u2019ve made a few purchases, or added money, we\u2019ll calculate the total we need to buy or sell at the trading cut-off time to make sure everything matches up.\n\n **Tip:** If you\u2019re worried about accidentally spending from a Balance you hold as Stocks \u2014 set aside the money in a Jar instead. Then change how it\u2019s held, from Cash to Stocks.\n\nLearn how to set aside money in a Jar",

We\u2019re working on expanding it to more customers, and we\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re done.**\n\nWhen you hold your money as stocks you pay two fees: a service fee and a fund fee. \n\n### What\u2019s the service fee?\n\nWe charge the service fee. This is an annual fee of 0.4% which we charge as a monthly fee of 0.033% (that's 0.4% divided by 12). We calculate it daily based on the amount you hold as stocks in your Balances and Jars \u2014 and we charge it on the 1st day of the following month.\n\nWe\u2019ll always take the service fee from a Balance \u2014 we don\u2019t charge the fee to Jars. _Jars_ are designed to help you keep money where it can\u2019t be withdrawn accidentally. The only way you can use money in Jars is to move it out yourself.\n\nThis means if you hold a Jar as stocks, we\u2019ll charge the fee to your Balance that\u2019s in the same currency. This Balance can be held as Cash or Stocks. So, if you have a Jar held as Stocks in GBP, we\u2019ll charge the fee to your GBP balance.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have enough money in that Balance to pay the fee, we\u2019ll take it from another Balance that does have money in it. \n\n### What\u2019s the total fee?\n\nFor example, if you'd invest 1000 GBP in our Stocks fund and leave it there for one year (and assuming the fund would not increase/decrease in value), you'd pay a total fee of around 5,50 GBP. This would be a combination of the fee Wise charges, and the fee charged by the fund manager. \n\n### What\u2019s the fund fee?\n\nBlackRock charges the fund fee. The fund fee is 0.15% annually. It\u2019s automatically reflected in the value of your investment, so you won\u2019t see it charged to your account as a separate fee.\n\n###  **You won\u2019t pay any other fees**\n\nWhen you hold money as stocks, you won\u2019t pay any fees apart from the service and fund fees.\n\nThe Key Investor Information Document mentions an **entry fee, but this** **isn\u2019t charged** to Wise customers.\n\nBecause we charge a service fee, **you don\u2019t need to pay any** **trading fees** to cover _your investment transactions_.\n\nAnd while the fund\u2019s currency is EUR, **you won\u2019t pay a conversion fee** if your account or Jar is held in another currency.\n\nYou\u2019ll only pay a conversion fee if you add money to your account or Jar and it\u2019s in a different currency. This is the same fee we always charge for _converting currencies_.",

So if one company doesn\u2019t do so well, your total investment can be less affected.\n\nThe iShares World Equity Index Fund has a risk rating of 6 out of 7. This is an industry standard rating for funds like this, with 0 being least risky and 7 being most.\n\nThe fund has this risk rating because it invests in company shares in the developed world, rather than less risky assets like bonds or cash. So while you could see good returns in the long run, the value of the fund may go up and down more often in the short term.\n\n### How does the fund work?\n\nIndex-tracking funds like this buy stocks in all the companies in an index. Indexes are hypothetical portfolios of stocks, used to represent different markets.\n\nThe fund we\u2019ve chosen tracks the MSCI World Index, which represents the stock market of developed countries. So it buys stocks in the biggest companies in the world, like Apple, Microsoft and Tesla. The index has stocks in over 1500 companies.\n\nWhen you put money into this fund, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re investing in all the companies in the MSCI World Index. And your investment will go up and down daily, depending on how the fund performs.\n\n### Making the decision to hold a Balance or Jar as Stocks\n\nEven though the fund can produce good returns in the long term, this isn\u2019t guaranteed. You should only invest if you\u2019re comfortable with the possibility of losing some money and investment should always be regarded as long term.\n\n **Wise isn\u2019t able to give you advice about investments.** If you\u2019re not sure whether investing in the index fund is right for you, you should speak to an independent financial adviser and/or conduct your own research.",

Log into your Wise account in the app \n\n  2. Go to your currency account or jar held as Stocks\n\n  3. Click on the Stocks icon\n\n\n\n\nOn the following pages you will see:\n\n _ **Your gains graph:**_ it reflects two types of gains \u2014 \u201crealised\u201d and \u201cunrealised\u201d gains. Learn more about them below. \n\n_**Fund performance graph:**_ The relative performance of the fund in percentage across the period of time selected.\n\nYou can easily toggle between different time periods below the graph to see the data most relevant to you. \n\n#### **What are gains?**\n\nThe gains value shows the difference in value of the stocks when you switched your account or jar from Cash to Stocks, compared to the selected date. It helps you understand how the value of the stock has changed over time.\n\nTo understand the gains graph fully, it\u2019s good to know that it reflects two types of gains \u2014 \u201crealised\u201d and \u201cunrealised\u201d gains. \n\n**Realised gains** are calculated from the units you have sold to send money, withdraw or spend from Stocks. For each of these transactions Wise sells some units to cover the respective amounts. If the fund performance has increased, then fewer units would need to be sold. If the fund performance has decreased, then more units would need to be sold. In both cases, this difference is the realised gains. The accumulation of these differences from the day you started investing to a given date, is the realised gains up to that date.\n\n **Unrealised gains** are calculated from the units you have remaining as Stocks. In other words, anything you haven\u2019t withdrawn, sent or spent yet. It looks at the difference between the price of the units on a particular day and the prices of those units on the day they were purchased. Again, unrealised gains can be positive or negative.\n\n###  **Checking the performance of your investment using the Standard and Accounting statement**\n\nThese reports can be found by the **...** or **More \u2026** on currency account or jar page, and selecting the option of **Statements**.\n\nIn both statements there will be a line above the last transaction called **Earnings since start**.\n\n **Earnings since start** lets you know the difference between holding money as Stocks versus Cash since the day you started investing in this currency account or jar. \n\nThis is done by comparing the value of your currency account or jar by using the fund price on the last day on the statement against a summation of all the historical cash transactions, which effectively produces the balance your currency account or jar would have had if it were always held as cash.\n\nIf the price of the fund unit dropped since you invested your currency account or jar, you may see a negative amount as **Earning since start**. \n\n### **How can I access my earnings?**\n\nWe offer an _Accumulating fund class_ \u2013 so any income from the underlying assets (e.g. cash dividends from a company in the fund) are reinvested by the fund manager back into the fund. When you withdraw or spend money from this Balance or Jar, or when you convert it back to Cash, your earnings will be realised.\n\nIf you buy units and their price goes up, your investment has grown. This means that a unit is worth more compared to when you bought it. It also means that you spend less units if you choose to sell at that price.\n\nWhen you spend or send from your account, we sell the equivalent number of units. So, to access your earnings, you just need to spend your money. There\u2019s no need to divest the balance or Jar held as Stocks.",

Keep in mind that offshore reporting funds and the tax rules governing the regime are complex. \n\n**Wise can't provide tax advice and we recommend that you seek advice from a tax adviser.**\n\n###  **What's the difference between UK and non-UK investment funds?**\n\nInvestment funds in the UK are generally required to distribute any income they earn. Offshore funds don\u2019t have this requirement. . Funds based outside of the UK (offshore funds) don\u2019t have this requirement. Offshore funds that comply with the _UK Reporting Fund regime_ are likely to retain any earned income \u2014 this is known as Excess Reportable Income (ERI).\n\nERI applies to any UK investor that invests in an offshore reporting fund outside of an Individual Savings Account (ISA) or a Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). ERI is deemed to be distributed 6 months after the fund accounting year ends. It will either be taxed as dividend or interest income, depending on the underlying assets of the fund. \n\n### **What\u2019s the fund status of the Wise Assets?**\n\nCurrently, Wise only offers **UK reporting funds.** This is to preserve the capital gain treatment of disposals. We are committed to provide each customer with the relevant data and information to manage any ERI impact. \n\n_Keep in mind:_ if you invest in an offshore fund outside of an ISA or SIPP that does not have UK reporting fund status, any gain on the disposal of any units will be taxed as ordinary income and not as capital gain. \n\n### **What is the impact of the Wise Assets to UK taxpayers?**\n\nThe underlying assets of any UK reporting fund determines how HMRC will treat any ERI or distributed income from the fund. \n\nThe iShares World Equity Index Fund (ISIN: LU0852473015) is primarily composed of equity securities (e.g. shares), so any ERI earned by this fund should be considered as dividend income. \n\nERI is eligible for annual allowances in the UK. Please note that UK allowances are subject to change and are dependent on each person\u2019s individual circumstances. You can find more information in the HMRC publications on _dividends_ and _interest_.\n\n###  **How does Excess Reportable Income affect capital gains?**\n\nFor UK tax residents, any gain from the disposal of an investment in a reporting fund is subject to capital gains tax. The ERI amounts subjected to income tax should generally be added to the base cost of the investment.This will reduce the gain subject to capital gains tax.\n\nThis will be reflected in your UK tax statements from 15 December 2022 if applicable.",

These are funds that invest only in the safest securities, namely government securities. Let\u2019s break it down. \n\n##### **_Public debt_**\n\nWhen you hold your money in Interest, it\u2019s being invested in government bonds and government backed assets. According to the regulations applicable to money market funds, at least 99.5% of the funds\u2019 assets will be government bonds or government backed securities. For example, if you invest in the USD money market fund, this means bonds issued by the US government or loans backed by those bonds as collateral. If an institution isn't able to repay the loan, the fund still owns the underlying government bonds to fall back on. \n\nUltimately, there is a risk that the government will not be able to pay its debt. However, this is extremely unlikely. The Interest funds we offer only invest in government bonds of governments with high credit ratings, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. These ratings are allocated by specialist credit rating agencies, such as S&P or Moody\u2019s. \n\n##### **_Constant net asset value_**\n\nMoney market funds like the ones we offer through Interest are designed to maintain capital, and not go down in value. This means that, even if the market price of government bonds can go down, these funds look at the price of the asset at maturity. Day-to-day fluctuations of the value of the underlying assets do not impact the net asset value of the funds. In technical terms, it means that the assets are valued using the so-called amortised cost methodology. \n\n##### **_Short-term_**\n\nMoney market funds like the ones we offer through Interest limit their investments to assets which only have a short period left (i.e. just over 1 year) before they have to be fully repaid. Money market funds are subject to strict rules to make sure they only invest in short-term bonds. These types of bonds are less sensitive to price fluctuations when interest rates change, compared to bonds with a longer maturity. Also, the funds are actively managed, meaning the fund managers make investment decisions based on whether or not they anticipate interest rates to go up or down any time soon and to ensure the funds\u2019 maturity profile remains optimal.",

However, an investment is never guaranteed and it\u2019s possible that the net asset value of a money market fund decreases. \n\nThe most likely cause of negative returns within a money market fund are negative interest rates or interest rates close to 0%. We have seen this in the Eurozone (and EUR \u2018Interest\u2019 fund) in the last decade - interest rates set by the European Central Bank were negative during this period. As a result, the EUR \u2018Interest\u2019 fund decreased in value during this time. \n\nAnother scenario would be governments going bankrupt, and not being able to pay back their debt. The Interest funds we offer only invest in government bonds of governments with high credit ratings, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. It is extremely unlikely that these countries would go bankrupt and won\u2019t be able to pay back their loans. \n\nLooking back at data from the last 10 years, data suggests that in a scenario of stress, the worst case scenario, your holdings could be impacted in the following way. This is the impact if you would hold the money in Interest for one year. \n\n  * $10,000 invested could be worth $9,990 after 1 year. \n\n  * \u00a310,000 invested could be worth \u00a39,990 after 1 year.\n\n  * \u20ac10,000 invested could be worth \u20ac9,930 after 1 year.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the above numbers are based on past performance (as of March 2023) of the last 10 years, which does not guarantee future performance. \n\nYou can learn more _here_ about what happens if Wise or our fund manager becomes insolvent \n\n#### **Understanding the risks**\n\nThese funds hold assets that are backed by governments. This is why this fund is deemed to be very low risk. However, during periods of extreme volatility access to this fund may be temporarily restricted in order to preserve the value of your investment.\n\nAn interest-earning fund is not a guaranteed investment and the fund does not rely on external support for guaranteeing the liquidity of the fund or stabilising the NAV per share. The risk of loss of the amount is borne by the investor. \n\nThere is always a risk involved with holding money, depending on how and where it is held. Even if it\u2019s held as cash, your money is vulnerable to inflation and your deposit at a bank is only insured up to a certain amount. This amount is set per region/country.\n\n* * *\n\nInterest-earning funds are currently not available for US customers, but you might be still eligible to earn interest on your money if you live in the US.\n\nLearn more about earning interest on your Wise account it you live in the US",

It\u2019s currently available for Wise account-holder residents in Australia, Brazil, the EEA, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Switzerland, the UK, the US and Canada. \n\nHere are some tips to help you get started.\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. Get your card details on the app or website\n\nFor cards issued **** for _ ****_ these countries, you can see your card number, expiry date, and CVV any time on the app or website:\n\n  * the UK\n\n  * the EEA\n\n  * Switzerland\n\n  * Australia\n\n  * New Zealand\n\n  * Singapore\n\n  * Japan \n\n  * Malaysia\n\n  * Canada\n\n  * Brazil\n\n\n\n\nFor cards issued in the US, you can set your own PIN when you activate your card. Cards issued in the US can only be activated in the US. Card details are available in the app after activation, so it's important to complete this before going abroad. \n\nOnce you got your card details, you can start using them online or add them to a mobile wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Activate your card immediately\n\n **Non-US cardholders**\n\nYou just need to pay using your PIN. If the Chip and PIN payment gets declined, please use the card at an ATM for either cash withdrawal or balance enquiry.\n\nIf you are trying to activate your card in **Canada** or **Singapore** , you won\u2019t be able to make a cash withdrawal at local ATMs. Please choose Balance Inquiry in order to activate your card. \n\nBalance enquiry is not supported for cards issued in **Brazil**. Please try a Chip and PIN payment or cash withdrawal at an ATM instead.\n\nIf you are trying to activate your card in **Japan** , remember you may only be able to use it at one of these ATM providers: AEON, E-net, Daily Yamazaki.\n\n **US cardholders**\n\nTo activate your card: go to your Wise account in the app or website, and enter the 6-digit code that\u2019s on the card. \n\nOnce activated, you can use your card any time, as long as you have money in your account.\n\nLearn more about activating your card\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Add money to your Wise account\n\nTo pay with your card, you\u2019ll need money in your Wise account.\n\nAdd money by opening the Wise app, choosing the currency you\u2019d like to add money to, and how much you\u2019d like to add. Then, choose to pay using different payment methods like bank transfer or card.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Leave the conversion to us\n\nIf you spend money in a currency you already have in your balances, we\u2019ll deduct the amount for free.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the currency in your account, we\u2019ll automatically convert the amount for you. We\u2019ll take it from whichever available balance has the cheapest conversion fee. So there\u2019s no need to worry about converting money before travelling.\n\n **For Brazil cardholders**\n\nKeep in mind: the smart conversion will not work for Brazilian cards when the BRL account is involved. \n\nIf you want to use your card in Brazil, you need to have money on your Brazilian Real balance. If you want to use your card abroad, you need to have money on any other balance. If you try to spend in a currency that you don\u2019t have and BRL is the only available currency, the transaction will be declined due to insufficient funds.\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. Always choose the local currency\n\nSometimes, ATMs, shops, and online stores are sneaky \u2014 they try to charge you more when you withdraw cash or buy something abroad. They do it by offering to charge you in your home currency, then marking up the exchange rate.\n\nAvoid these hidden fees by always choosing to be charged in the local currency of where you are.\n\n* * *",

And we charge transparent fees for spending in currencies you don\u2019t have in your account and withdrawing cash after a certain amount.\n\n### Getting your card\n\nWe might ask you to add money to your balance or pay a small fee to get the card.\n\n### Spending with your card \n\n  * If you have the currency in your account, it\u2019s free\n\n  * If you don\u2019t have the currency in your account, there\u2019s a conversion fee. Check our pricing. \n\n  * For Brazil cardholders: please keep in mind that the smart conversion will not work for Brazilian cards when the BRL balance is involved. You can learn more here. \n\n  * If you\u2019re spending online, the seller might try to charge their own conversion fee. This could happen even if you have the other currency in your account. To avoid this, ask the seller to charge you in the currency you want\n\n\n\n\n ** _Keep in mind:_** Because of the ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus now requires all card transactions to use a conversion rate set by them for BYN payments. This means that we can no longer use the mid-market rate to calculate fees when you spend or withdraw money with your Wise card in **Belarus**. Instead, we\u2019re now using the rate set by the National Bank. Change is in effect from 16 May 2022, and only affects BYN payments. \n\n### Withdrawing cash from an ATM\n\nYou get 2 free withdrawals up to 200 GBP total (or whatever currency is equivalent) per month.\n\nLearn more about ATM fees\n\n### Replacing your card \n\nIf you need to replace your card, you might need to pay a small fee to receive a new one.

If you\u2019re using a different currency, the sum will be equivalent to the currency your card was issued in.\n\nIf you withdraw cash in a currency you're not currently holding, we'll charge a conversion fee to convert it for you. If you have multiple cards on your account, the fees apply per account.\n\nKeep in mind that these are fees Wise charges on your card. Some ATMs may charge additional fees over these. We have no way of predicting those charges, but they\u2019re usually visible on the ATM before you agree to the withdrawal. \n\nIf you change your registered address after moving to another country and order a new card, we\u2019ll automatically update the cash withdrawal fees for all your cards \u2014 to reflect the fees that apply to your new country of residence. If you set up your Wise account before 2 March 2023, we'll do this update for you on 22 May 2023.\n\n###  **What fees do I have to pay to Wise?**\n\nYou get 2 free withdrawals per calendar month. From the third withdrawal, we\u2019ll charge you the fixed fee applicable in your region, regardless of how much money you've withdrawn that month.\n\nYou also get a free withdrawal allowance each calendar month. This is the amount you can take out without paying a variable rate. We\u2019ll charge you a variable rate if you go over your free allowance, regardless of how many withdrawals you made that month. \n\nYou can find these fees and rates on the below table.

If you\u2019re on the website, go to **Cards.** If you\u2019re on the app, go to **Card.**\n\n  2. Click on **Change PIN**\n\n  3. Type the desired PIN number twice and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll only be able to change your PIN while you\u2019re in the US. Remember, you can only choose a 4-digit PIN. \n\n### What do I do if my PIN is blocked? \n\nIf you enter the wrong PIN 3 times, we\u2019ll block it and you won\u2019t be able to use your card. If this happens, you\u2019ll need to unblock your PIN in the Wise app. To do this:\n\n  1. Open your Wise app\n\n  2. Go to **Card**\n\n  3. Choose **Unblock PIN**\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll now be able to use your card online. But to use contactless again with your card, you\u2019ll need to make a payment using your chip and PIN first.",

It usually takes 3 \u2013 4 days for the merchant to claim the money from your account.

There\u2019s no need to contact us. \n\n#### Here are a few examples:\n\n**Amazon Prime** \u2014 If you see a charge on your account from Amazon Prime/UK Prime, this means you\u2019ve signed up for an Amazon Prime subscription.\n\nContact Amazon customer support to manage this subscription or click here to find out more about cancelling it.\n\n **Apple.com** \u2014 **Apple.com/bill** **** appears on your billing statement when you buy an app, music, movie, or other content from Apple. It also appears when a subscription renews, or when a family member buys apps or content from Apple. \n\nFind out more about this on Apple's support page\n\n **eDreams Prime** \u2014 **** eDreams Prime is a service offered by eDreams **.** It often **** starts as a **free trial** that renews automatically.

Often they\u2019ll use a different name which will show up on your account. This is called discreet billing.\n\nThese merchants usually have a website in the merchant name. If you head to this website, you can cancel the subscription.\n\nIf you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve cancelled the subscription but are still being charged, you can submit a dispute to us. Choose \u201cI was charged for a subscription I cancelled\u201d as the reason for submitting a dispute.\n\n **Tip:** If you sign up for a free trial, set a reminder on your phone for a few days before it ends. That way you can cancel in time before you\u2019re charged for a full subscription.\n\nIf you still want to file our dispute form for this subscription, make sure to send us the communication with the merchant and their terms and conditions.\n\nIn case you've already cancelled your subscription, we also suggest to get in touch with the merchant and ask for a refund. If they're not able to help, file our dispute form, send us the cancellation confirmation, and we\u2019ll take care of it for you.",

Go to **Home**\n\n  2. Choose **Open**\n\n  3. Select **Balance**\n\n  4. Choose one of the currencies that has account details.\n\n  5. Once you have the balance opened, click on **Receive** on the website, or **More** on the app.\n\n  6. Select **Get account details**\n\n  7. If it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re getting account details, you might need to complete some requirements first.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed all of the requirements, you\u2019ll have your own account details that can be shared with whoever wants to send you money \u2014 friends, companies, or customers.\n\nLearn more on how can I get an account ownership document\n\n### What are the requirements for my personal Wise account?\n\nTo get your first set of account details, we'll ask you to:\n\n  * add 20 GBP to your account (or the equivalent in your currency)\n\n  * verify your identity\n\n\n\n\nIf you're getting USD or EUR account details, you'll need to upload a photo of yourself holding your ID as part of verifying your identity. \n\n### What are the requirements for my Wise Business account?\n\n **For EEA, Switzerland and the UK:** you'll need to pay a 45 GBP (50 EUR) fee when signing up \u2014 this is a one-time onboarding fee. You won't be charged extra to open account details to receive money. \n\n**For other regions:** it's free to sign up, and the fee to open account details depends on where your business is registered. You can check our pricing page what fee we'll charge you \u2014 it can be 16-42 GBP (or equivalent in another currency). Some countries cost us more to verify you, so we might charge you a higher fee. You can only pay the fee using your debit/credit card, or from your balance. If you want to pay from a balance, you would first need to add money to your account.\n\nAfter paying the fee, we\u2019ll get started on verifying your business. Once verified, you\u2019ll get your account details. If we can\u2019t verify your business, we\u2019ll refund the fee back to you. \n\nYou only have to do these 2 steps for the first set of account details you get. After that, you can freely get account details for any of the other currencies that have them. \n\nAll of your account details will also show in your **Manage** tab in the **Account details** section.",

Most banks will auto-generate this using the SWIFT database. If the person paying you needs routing information, use the following details:\n\n  * Recipient SWIFT code/BIC: TRWIBEB1XXX\n\n  * Correspondent SWIFT code/BIC: BARCGB22\n\n\n\n\nYou should only send EUR to these account details. If we receive payments to these EUR account details in any other currency, it'll get rejected and sent back to the sender.\n\nBut if the sending bank sends a SWIFT payment to us through another correspondent BIC (in another currency), the intermediary banks along the way might convert it to EUR \u2014 in this case, we can credit it to your EUR account. \n\n### Set up Direct Debits with your EUR account details \n\nYou can share your details with a company, and give them the permission to take regular payments from your account. \n\nYou might use Direct Debits to pay for a monthly subscription like the gym, or to pay your phone or energy bill.\n\nLearn more about Direct Debits\n\n### What if my EUR account details aren\u2019t working?\n\n **I can\u2019t set up a Direct Debit**\n\nYour EUR account details support Direct Debits via the SEPA core direct debit scheme.

For example, a Spanish gym might not accept your IBAN because it\u2019s based in Belgium.\n\nMerchants are required by EU law to accept IBANs from other members of the European Economic Area (EEA). So, if someone doesn\u2019t accept your IBAN, please let us know using this form. \n\nYou can also report merchants who don\u2019t accept your IBAN to the relevant authority in your country. \n\n**A bank isn\u2019t recognising my Wise account details**\n\nThere are banks \u2014 particularly outside of Europe \u2014 who may not recognise your account details. If a bank won\u2019t let you or someone who wants to pay you send money to your Wise account, there are 2 things you should do.\n\n  1. Tell us by filling out this form\n\n  2.

Just share your account name and number, and routing number with your friends, company or customers, and they can send you USD from any US bank account.\n\nWhen your sender enters your account details in their bank's system, they might see Community Federal Savings Bank (CFSB) if the routing number starts with 026, or Evolve Bank and Trust (EVOLVE) if the routing number starts with 084. This is because Wise's USD accounts are with both CFSB, and EVOLVE. \n\nYour sender's bank may ask for e-teller ID, but we won't have this information. When setting up the transfer, your sender should add your account details manually instead of selecting Evolve or CFSB from a list of available banks. \n\nIf you have any questions about your account, always talk to Wise support team \u2014 CFSB or EVOLVE won\u2019t be able to give you any information, because you don't have an account directly with them.\n\nLearn more on how we keep the money in your account safe and about earning interest on your Wise account if you live in the US. \n\nCheck the limits for how much you can receive into your Wise USD balance.\n\n### How do I receive USD from inside the US?\n\n **If your routing number starts with 084**\n\nYour single routing number will work for both ACH and wire transfers.\n\n **If your routing number starts with 026**\n\nProvide your ACH (ABA) routing number if you\u2019re:\n\n  * being paid a salary\n\n  * receiving earnings from platforms, such as Amazon\n\n  * receiving direct deposits\n\n  * receiving non-urgent payments\n\n\n\n\nACH payments, also known as electronic money transfers, are the most common payment method in the US. They\u2019re usually free, or cost a lower fee for your sender. They typically take 2\u20133 working days to reach Wise.\n\nProvide your wire routing number if your sender specifically wants to pay you with a wire. Wire transfers can cost your sender 20\u201330 USD, but will reach your Wise account within 1 working day. If someone sends you money using a wire transfer, we\u2019ll charge a 4.14 USD fee. \n\nCheck the latest fees\n\n **What if my sender used the wrong routing number?**\n\nIf your sender uses the wrong routing number, the money will bounce back to their account within 3 working days.\n\nIf the money hasn\u2019t gotten back to them in that time, they should get in touch with their bank to set up a trace on the money.\n\n **Tip:** Check out our blog post all about different US payment methods.",

Unfortunately, we can\u2019t accept payments from business bank accounts if you only have a personal Wise account. \n\n**Tip:** Open a Wise Business account to send money from business bank accounts.\n\n **I\u2019ve already sent money from a business bank account**\n\nIf you\u2019ve already sent money from a business bank account and you don\u2019t have a Wise Business account \u2014 or you\u2019ve accidentally used your personal Wise account \u2014 here\u2019s what you can do. \n\n**If you accidentally used your personal Wise account instead of your Wise Business account \u2014 don\u2019t worry**\n\nIf you already have a Wise Business account, but accidentally used your personal Wise account to set up your transfer, you don\u2019t need to do anything. \n\nWe can normally fix this ourselves, and send your money anyway. It\u2019s rare that we\u2019d need more information from you. But if we do, we\u2019ll get in touch via email.\n\n **If you used a personal Wise account and you don\u2019t have a Wise Business account, we can\u2019t process your payment**\n\nThe easiest way to fix this is to cancel the transfer yourself. Then, open a Wise Business account and restart your transfer. Verifying a new account can take 4-7 business days, so your transfer will take longer.\n\n **Tip:** Whether you can cancel your transfer depends on how far along it is in our system. To see what stage it\u2019s at, track the transfer in your account. From there, match the status of your transfer to the correct heading below before reading on.\n\n **If you\u2019ve set up a transfer or your money\u2019s on its way to us, you can cancel yourself**\n\nYou may see a different message for this step, like \u2018Your money may still be in your bank account\u2019, or \u2018Sorry, we didn\u2019t get the money yet\u2019. This is fine \u2014 you should still be able to cancel, and we\u2019ll refund the money. ****\n\n**Tip:** Learn how to cancel your transfer\n\n **If your money\u2019s being processed, we\u2019ll email you**\n\nAt this point, the money\u2019s reached Wise, and you can\u2019t cancel the transfer yourself. We\u2019ll stop the transfer and get in touch with you. \n\nPlease look out for an email from Wise. It\u2019ll ask whether you\u2019d like to:\n\n  * Tell us this is a business transfer and set up a Wise Business account to continue.\n\n  * Or cancel your transfer and get a refund.\n\n\n\n\n **Tip:** This email is sent automatically \u2014 so it may be faster and smoother to fix this over email, than it is to get in touch with us.",

They can\u2019t access your personal account. \n\nAdmins and Employees can have their own Wise business card in supported countries. You can simply transfer ownership of your Wise business account to another Admin.\n\nLearn more about how to add people to your Wise business account.\n\n **Read on to learn what each role can do, or scroll down for a table on roles and permissions.**\n\n* * *\n\n### What can Viewers do?\n\nViewers can:\n\n  * see all account activity\n\n  * download statements\n\n  * download receipts\n\n  * manage accounting bank feeds\n\n\n\n\nViewers can\u2019t do anything else \u2014 like make payments, or manage users or recipients.\n\nThis role lets you give your accountant, or anyone else who needs to do reporting for your business, access to your transactions.\n\n### What can Employees do?\n\nEmployees can get their own Wise business card, but they don\u2019t have access to the business details or activity. They can\u2019t do anything else \u2014 like make payments, or manage users or recipients.\n\nThis role is perfect for corporate buyers, or for the purpose of petty cash.\n\n### What can Preparers do?\n\nPreparers can set up single payments of any amount that require approval from an Admin. This role gives Admins more control over payments.\n\nPreparers can:\n\n  * set up transfer orders\n\n  * see all account activity\n\n  * download statements\n\n  * download receipts\n\n  * manage accounting bank feeds\n\n  * contact Customer Support for general advice\n\n  * manage recipients\n\n\n\n\n### What can Payers do?\n\nPayers can:\n\n  * make and manage payments\n\n  * manage accounting software feeds\n\n  * convert balances\n\n  * see all account activity\n\n  * download statements\n\n\n\n\nPayers have less authority on the business account than Admins. They can contact Customer Support on behalf of the business, but they can't manage members, get their own Wise business debit card, or open or close a balance.\n\nThis role is best suited for financial managers, or for anyone that needs to manage payments for the business. \n\n### What can Admins do?\n\nAdmins are authorised to do anything that the Account Owner can do. This role lets those with full authority represent your business manage the business account.\n\n###  **Custom Roles**\n\nCustom Roles is a feature which allows Admins and Owners to mix and match access and permissions for other team members.\n\nTo add a Custom Role, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Go to the **Team tab**.\n\n  2. Select **Roles**.\n\n  3. Click on **Create role**. You\u2019ll see the option to add a role name (for example \u201cHR Department\u201d) and a short description.\n\n  4. Toggle to select accesses for this role. You can choose from these categories: _Payments and Receipts, Balances, Integrations, Cards, Team Management._\n\n  5. Assign an existing user to this role or set it up later \u2014 that\u2019s it!\n\n\n\n\nTo edit a Custom Role:\n\n  1. Go to the **Team** tab.\n\n  2. Scroll down and edit the role by clicking on the three dots next to the role name. You can also assign this role to another team member. \n\n\n\n\nIf you want to delete a Custom Role, make sure to reassign your team members to another role first. \n\n* * *",

Matching Contacts allows us to automatically record your transactions with more accuracy.\n\nFor example, if you spend your Wise card with \u2018Supplier 1\u2019, but we don\u2019t find a \u2018Supplier 1\u2019 in your Contacts list, we\u2019ll create a \u2018Supplier 1\u2019 Contact for you.
