# Holding money basics  
## How does balance cashback work?  
Currently, we're offering balance cashback to all customers in the European Economic Area (EEA) as set out below. 

### **Why is Wise paying cashback?**

Wise keeps your money safe in accounts that are separate from the ones we use to run our business. The accounts are approved by the regulators. Your funds aren't at risk. As interest rates have risen, Wise is now starting to generate income from the money you hold with us. It's interest on your money, so we believe it's right to share it with you. 

Our mission is money without borders — to make it instant, cheap, convenient and transparent. See how _you can help_.

###  **How is cashback calculated?**

Wise pays balance cashback each month based on the EUR, GBP and USD you hold in your Wise account. You agree that the cashback rate is variable and that we may change the rate and/or stop paying cashback at any time. For eligible balances held in Wise accounts in May 2023, Wise paid an annualised cashback rate of:

  * 1.79% for any EUR

  * 3.12% for any GBP

  * 3.85% for any USD




Wise Europe operates within the tax jurisdiction of Belgium, where cashback is liable for 30% withholding tax.

We deduct this tax and pay it to the Belgian tax authorities before we add the cashback to your account.

For example — if you held a balance of 1,000 GBP and a Jar of 2,000 EUR for a whole month, you would receive 1.80 GBP back to your balance and 2.06 EUR into your Jar. We would have already deducted 30% to pay the withholding tax for both transactions.

Based on the cashback rates for May 2023, you would need to hold a minimum balance of 39 GBP, 68 EUR or 32 USD for the whole month to receive cashback.

 **Who's eligible for cashback?**

You'll receive cashback for any funds and jars with a positive balance of EUR, GBP and USD held in your Wise account.

You won’t receive cashback if:

  * your Wise account is outside of the EEA (any days your account was registered outside of the EEA won’t be eligible for cashback)

  * you don't hold EUR, GBP or USD

  * your money is held in our Assets funds — Interest or Stocks (any days you hold money as Assets won’t be eligible for cashback)

  * you close an eligible balance or jar before cashback is paid

  * your account is suspended or deactivated

  * your balance is negative

  * the pre-tax amount of cashback would be less than 0.10 in an eligible currency

  * you've opted out of receiving balance cashback

  * we believe you have breached our Customer Agreement




###  **Do I need to pay tax?**

Wise Europe operates within the tax jurisdiction of Belgium, where cashback is liable for 30% withholding tax. 

This tax is paid by Wise but you may be able to claim some, or all, of the tax back depending on your tax status and country of residence. We are currently working on providing a tax statement to help with tax reporting. We recommend that you obtain independent advice or consult with the tax authority of your country of residence.

###  **Do you share personal information with the tax authorities?**

No. Wise Europe files a monthly withholding tax return with the Belgian tax authority showing the total withholding tax due each month. We do not reveal any personal information.

We keep customer data on file internally for audit and documentation purposes. We would only provide customer details to the tax authority if requested and according to GDPR regulations.

###  **Can I get a statement for reporting tax?**

We’re working on providing tax statements to help you with reporting for your tax affairs. 

###  **Can I get a tax reduction or refund?**

Currently, we're unable to apply withholding tax reductions as we do not collect tax residency information.

If you’re eligible for a lower withholding tax rate under the Belgium double tax treaty with your country of residence, apply to the Belgian tax authority using the _official form for refund of Belgian WHT (Form 276 INT)_. We are working on providing a tax statement (credit advice) to help you with this application. 

The process to obtain a refund may differ for each country so seek advice from a tax adviser if you are unsure.

###  **How can I opt out of balance cashback?**

Wise has automatically enrolled all customers in the EEA into receiving balance cashback.

If you’d like to stop receiving balance cashback, you can opt out at any time. 

Cashback rates are for balances held in May 2023.
