###  **What happens if I hold my money in Interest or Stocks and I move countries?**

Your money will remain invested, but keep in mind:

  * You can keep the Balances and Jars you already have invested in Interest or Stocks. You won’t be able to add more money to these and you won’t be able to switch other Balances and Jars to Interest or Stocks, until you move back to a country where they are available.

  * If you decide to switch your Balance or Jar back to Cash, you won’t be able to reinvest it until you move back to a country where Interest or Stocks are available. 




**Two exceptions are the US and Brazil. If your new address is in one of these countries we’ll switch your invested Balances and Jars back to Cash (which means we’ll sell all your units) as soon as the address has been updated.**

###  **Can I use Interest and Stocks if I’m a US citizen/tax payer?**

Not yet. Because of how our fund partner is regulated we can’t onboard US citizens/tax payers. You can’t switch your Balances and Jars to Interest or Stocks if you have US dual citizenship either. 

While Wise Interest isn't available in the US, there are other ways you can earn interest through Wise. Learn more about earning interest on your Wise account if you live in the US
