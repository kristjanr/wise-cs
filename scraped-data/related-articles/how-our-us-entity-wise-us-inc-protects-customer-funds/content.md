## How our US entity, Wise US Inc. protects customer funds  
For our customers sending money with Wise or holding money in the Wise account in the US, in keeping with US state obligations, we **** protect **** our customers’ funds in a mix of cash in leading commercial banks and investments in secure liquid assets, primarily government bonds. We also keep your money separate from the money we use to run our business.

Here’s an overview of where we predominantly hold customer money in the US:

Secure Liquid Assets,US Government Bonds  
--- CSV table ends ---  


We hold funds in cash with the banks and in assets that are deemed low risk and highly liquid in order to diversify risk and maximise liquidity. We take this approach to make sure your money is highly liquid and therefore always available to you. 

We limit the term-to-maturity of any US Government Bonds we buy to 2 years or less and the average duration of funds held as US Government bonds is less than 6 months.

We are not a bank, which means we do not lend out our customers’ money to people or businesses. It also means our money transfer service and Wise account balances where you haven't opted into interest are not subject to FDIC insurance.

If you’ve opted-in to earn interest on your Wise account, you're able to take advantage of FDIC passthrough insurance on your USD balance up to 250,000 USD.
