## How does connecting to my bank to verify my income work?  
Connecting to your bank is a secure way for Wise to verify your income with the same information we’d get from a bank statement, but much faster and easier for you. 

It’s more convenient than uploading a document because all you need to do is log in to your bank via our partner, TrueLayer. TrueLayer is safe and FCA-regulated, just like Wise.

 **How to connect to your bank:**

  1. At the **verify your income** step, select **Connect to your bank.**

  2. Tick the box to give us consent to access your data, then continue

  3. You’ll be redirected to TrueLayer, where you’ll need to choose your bank from the list

  4. Click **allow** to give permission to access your bank account

  5. You’ll be taken to your bank’s website where you need to log in. You may also need to complete 2-step verification (like entering a code sent to your phone)

  6. Pick which account you’d like access to, and click to authorise

  7. That’s it — return to Wise to finish your transfer 




**What information does Wise get from my bank?**

Wise will see the same information we’d see if you uploaded a bank statement. That includes:

  * your account information

  * your transaction details from the last 3 months




This information might include sensitive data. That’s because we can see transaction details, like who you paid — so if this included a political party you donated to, for example, that counts as sensitive data. 

We always store your information securely, in line with our _privacy policy_.
