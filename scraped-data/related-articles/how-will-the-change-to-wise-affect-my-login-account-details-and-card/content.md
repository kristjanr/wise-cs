## How will the change to Wise affect my login, account details, and card?  
_Wise_ is the same account — but we've changed our name and logo. That means you can use us just as you always have: to send, spend, receive, and manage money around the world. 

### How do I log in to Wise?

We've moved to a new URL: Wise.com. So to use Wise, you'll need to _log in again_. Your login details on Wise are the details you used with Wise. 

Learn what to do if you’ve _forgotten your password_. 

### My password is auto-saved, and I can’t log in. What do I do?

A password manager, like Google or 1Password, saves your passwords for you so you don’t have to remember them.

Since TransferWise and Wise have different URLs, you won’t be able to log in using your password manager. Here’s what to do instead:

  1. Go to your password manager and find your password for transferwise.com 

  2. Copy your password

  3. Go to Wise.com

  4. Log in with your email address 

  5. Paste your password




 **Tip:** Save your password for Wise so you don’t have to do these steps again. 

### Will account details be changing? 

Not yet. You can still send and receive money to the same account details you’ve been using.

We might change our company name to Wise on our account details eventually — but we’ll let you know ahead of time. 

### Will my Wise card still work?

Yes — you can still use your Wise card, as long as it’s valid. You don’t need to replace it.
