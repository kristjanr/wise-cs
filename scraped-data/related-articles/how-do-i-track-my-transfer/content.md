## How do I track my transfer?  
We’ll always keep you updated on the progress of your transfer. We’ll email you when we’ve received and sent your money out. But you can view more details in your account, too. Here’s how. 

  1. Log in to your account

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list

  3. Select the transfer you want to track




Here, we’ll let you know when we receive your money and send it to your recipient’s bank. We’ll also tell you about any delays, and give you an up-to-date estimate of when the money will arrive.
