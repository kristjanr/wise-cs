## How do I verify my Japanese business?  
There are three things you’ll need to do to start sending JPY as a business: register and verify your personal account with Wise, set up a business profile, and verify your business. We’ll need some documents from you to do this, depending on the type of business you own.

### Register your business profile

Please enter the business details here.

### Verification for sole traders

If you're a sole trader, you must be the owner of the business to set up a business account. 

First, you'll need to create a personal account. You'll then need to:

  * Verify your personal account with ID, selfie, and a MyNumber document

  * Register the business name, address, business type and details of business activities




### Verification for other businesses

There are 5 common types of Japanese company which we can onboard with us:

  * 株式会社 (kabushiki-kaisha, "KK") For-profit corporation (INC)

  * 有限会社 (yugen-kaisha, "YK") Limited company 

  * 合同会社 (godo-kaisha, "GK") Limited liability company (LLC)

  * 合名会社 (gomei-kaisha, "GMK") General partnership

  * 合資会社 (goshi-kaisha, "GSK") Limited partnership (LP) 




Unfortunately, we can’t onboard trusts, foundations, charities and NPOs.

To verify one of the supported business types:

  * The representative needs to create a personal profile - if the representative lives in Japan they’ll then need to _verify their ID and selfie_ with a 4-digit verification code. In case the representative lives outside of Japan we would require a valid _ID_ and _Proof of Address_ document.

  * Register the following details: \- Business name \- Business type \- 13-digit Business MyNumber (法人番号), \- The details of the business \- Business address \- Shareholders and beneficial owners (name, date of birth, address)

  * Provide a Certificate of Registered Matters (issued within 6 months)

  * Register the representative’s email




### What is a beneficial owner?

For KK and YK businesses, a beneficial owner is:

  * The natural person who owns more than 50% of voting shares

  * If not the above, the natural person who owns more than 25% of voting shares

  * If neither of the above, the natural person who has a great influence on the company

  * If none of the above, a beneficial owner is the representative of the company




For GK, GMK and GSK business, a beneficial owner is:

  * The natural person who owns more than 50% of the company’s income

  * If not the above, the natural person who owns more than 25% of the company’s income

  * If neither of the above, the natural person who has a great influence on the company

  * If none of the above, a beneficial owner is the representative of the company




Additional notes:

  * We can’t onboard foreign-registered businesses (any businesses registered outside of Japan)

  * We can onboard a foreign company’s branch in Japan (like a UK company with a branch in Japan)

    * We’ll need an original registration document in that foreign country

    * Please mark the company type as Other

  * We may ask for extra information due to our partner’s request or regulatory reasons.
