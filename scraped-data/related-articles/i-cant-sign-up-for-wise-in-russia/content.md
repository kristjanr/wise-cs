## I can’t sign up for Wise in Russia  
We’re not able to serve customers in Russia at the moment. This means that you won’t be able to open a Wise account if your address is in Russia or you are located there. 

**Why is this happening?**

The impact of ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region mean it’s difficult to operate in Russia. So, we need to suspend new accounts for customers in Russia. We know this is a difficult situation, and we’re sorry.

 **Verification for new customers with an address outside of Russia**

We’re not able to service customers in Russia at the moment, however, if you are a Russian national and have a valid address outside of Russia, you should be able to use our services.

 **What documents do I need to get verified?**

We cannot accept IDs issued by the Russian government but you can get verified with any of the following documents:

  * Passport from a third country

  * Driving license from third country

  * Permanent residency card/Work visa

  * Copy of naturalization or citizenship certificate

  * Student visa valid for more than 6 months




In case you do not have any of the above, please contact our support team and let us know what other documents you have. Our team will be happy to assist and review your document.
