## How do I get a statement of the fees I've paid?  
You can now access a statement that sums up the fees that you've paid in your Wise profile in a previous year. This feature is currently not available for US based customers. 

You can download this statement from our website by following these steps:

  1. Go to **Manage**

  2. Click on **Statements and reports**

  3. Select **Statement of Fees**

  4. Choose the year you'd like to get the summary for




The statement can summarise the fees you've paid for as far back as you've had a Wise profile. The fees paid are categorised by currencies. 

This statement won't include the gains and losses you have incurred while using Assets.
