## What's a log in and approve transfer?  
A log in and approve transfer is a faster and easier way of making an online bank transfer. Instead of going to your online banking in a separate window or on a different device, you can log in to a secure page hosted by your bank and authorise a payment to us, without manually setting up a transfer. 

If you choose this option, you’ll need to enter your online banking details, pick which account you’d like to pay from and click approve. And that’s it — we do the rest. 

When your approval is successful, it’s only valid for that specific transfer, and for a limited amount of time.

Because the login page is a secure page hosted by your bank, Wise doesn’t have any access to the details you use to log in, or anything in your bank account, apart from the payment that you approve.
