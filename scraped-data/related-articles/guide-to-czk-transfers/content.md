### Sending to CZK

 **Who can I send CZK to?** **** You can send CZK to any bank account in the Czech Republic.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need to know their full name and bank account number. In the Czech Republic, their bank account number can be either:

  * a local bank account, made up of an optional prefix (6 digits), an account number (10 digits), and a bank code (4 digits)

  * an IBAN, usually 24 digits long, starting with CZ, and made up of a mix of numbers and letters




If you’re sending to a business or government authority, they may ask you to include a 10-digit variable, or a “symbol” reference, which they use to identify your payment. If you’ve been asked for this, include it in the reference field for the transfer when setting it up on Wise.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 25 million CZK per transfer.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once Wise receives and converts your money, it usually takes 1 working day to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.
