### Sending to JPY

 **Who can I send JPY to?**

You can send JPY to bank accounts located in Japan.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

For transfers under 1 Million JPY, you'll need their:

  * full bank account name (usually in Katakana)— this must match exactly what’s printed on the first inside page of the bankbook.

  * normally a 7 digit account number 

  * Account type — you can select either

`普通 (Futsuu) Savings/General` `貯蓄 (Chochiku) Savings Deposit` `当座 (Touza) Checking/Current`

  * bank name and branch — in English, Katakana, Kanji, or provide a bank or branch code




For transfers above 1 Million JPY, you'll need their:

  * full bank account name in Latin 

  * SWIFT/BIC code

  * account number 




**How much can I send?**

The amount you can send depends on the currency you’re sending from, so check the relevant currency article for more information. 

If you send more than 1 million JPY to Japan, we’ll send out the money by SWIFT. We’ll charge you a bit extra for this — you can see the fees here.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once Wise receives and converts your money, it usually takes 1 working day to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

If you are sending more than 1 Million JPY, it will take longer as we use the _SWIFT payment network_. When the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their handling fees. We can send SWIFT to most major Japanese banks, but please check with your recipient bank for more details.

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

**How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

It usually takes 0–2 working days for your money to get to Wise, depending on how you pay for your transfer. Then, we convert it and send it out. Conversion can take up to 2 working days.

**I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. The time it takes for you to get your refund depends on how you paid: 

  * Japanese debit card payments usually take around 5 -10 working days. But for some banks it can take up to 1–2 months.

  * Bank transfers take 1–2 working days




If you paid by bank transfer, we’ll need you to register your bank account details from the recipient tab so we can refund the money back to you.

We will also send you a notification email letting you know that you will need to enter your bank account details by logging into your Wise account.
