**Are there any restrictions on sending DKK?**

For regulatory reasons, we can’t accept money sent with MobilePay.

 **I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. The time it takes for you to get your refund depends on how you paid, 

  * Bank transfers take 1–2 working days

  * Trustly payments are instant during working hours; but can be up to 2 working days

  * Card payments take 2-10 working days




If you paid by bank transfer, we might need more information before sending your refund. We’ll send you an email if we do.

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
