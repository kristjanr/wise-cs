## My account is being closed  
We may close your account if you use it in a way that goes against our Customer Agreement. This could mean that we noticed:

  * exchange or trading of cryptocurrencies, or any other virtual currencies

  * payments for other regulated or illegal products and services

  * payments for restricted items, such as weaponry, military goods and services, or certain nonprofits




These are just examples — you can find more reasons in our Acceptable Use Policy. Our policies are there to keep your money safe, and they’re an important part of how we’re regulated.

We know how disruptive and unexpected this can be. We never take decisions to close accounts lightly, and they are handled with utmost attention and consideration.

## What this means for you 

You still have access to your money. You can withdraw, send and spend any money currently in your account — until the date it closes.

You can no longer:

  * add money to your account

  * receive money

  * pay bills or monthly subscriptions by Direct Debit — any current Direct Debits will be cancelled 




You may want to let people know they can no longer send money to your Wise account. 

## Before your account closes

Before your account closes, you should: 

  * move all your money to an account that’s not with Wise

  * download any statements you might need for tax purposes




Once your account closes you won’t be able to log in or access any money or information left in it — you’ll need to make an appeal to get your money returned.

## After your account closes

If you’re not happy with our decision to close your account, you can appeal it.

You can only appeal once your account is closed. We can't accept appeals made while your account is still open.

Making an appeal means we’ll review your case to see if we can reactivate your account. It doesn't mean we'll automatically change our decision.

Our Customer Support team is here to help, but they can't give you more information about why we’re closing your account. They don’t have access to this information.
