## What documents will I need to prove my business' source of funds?  
When you create and use your Wise business account, we might ask you for proof of where your business money comes from. This is how we’re regulated, and it helps us keep Wise safe for everyone. 

You might get asked for proof of your business’ funds:

  * when you open your account

  * if you make an unusually large transfer compared to your business’ normal activity

  * if you move an unusually large amount over time (for example, you move a lot in one month)




You’ll need to upload documents showing where your business' funds come from, with:

  * your business income amount (if you have more than one type of income, you’ll have to upload documents for each of them) 

  * your business name 

  * the issue date 

  * signatures, if applicable
