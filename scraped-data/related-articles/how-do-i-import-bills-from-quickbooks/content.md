## How do I import bills from QuickBooks?  
You’ll need to connect Wise to QuickBooks. To do this:

  1. Go to the Wise App Marketplace in Account

  2. Find the QuickBooks logo 

  3. Turn on **Import bills**




You’ll need to log in to QuickBooks to authorise the connection. 

As with the other QuickBooks connections, you’ll need to have multi-currency enabled to access this feature.
