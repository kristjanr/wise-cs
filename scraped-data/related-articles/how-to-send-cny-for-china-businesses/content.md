## How to Send CNY for China businesses  
#### How can I send Chinese yuan to a business recipient with Wise?

  1. Log into your Wise business account and set up a transfer to CNY.

  2. Then tell us who you’re sending to by entering your recipient's full name (in Latin characters only), bank account number, BIC/SWIFT code, and their address in Mainland China. Your recipient’s bank account must be a business account based in China and **denominated in CNY.**

  3. Give some information about why you’re sending the money.

  4. Check that all details are correct before paying for your transfer.




And that's it!

## Receiving money

Once Wise gets and converts your money, it usually arrives in your bank within 1 working day. 

Your recipient’s bank may ask them to show a business contract and invoice supporting this transfer.

 **Note** : if your invoice and contract is denominated in USD, please send USD to China instead. Wise also supports USD payments to businesses in China.

### What currencies can I send from?

You can send CNY from a business Wise account from these 19 currencies: AUD, BGN, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, HUF, JPY, NOK, NZD, PLN, RON, SEK, SGD and USD. 

You can also pay for your transfer with your Wise balance.

### Who can I send to?

If you have a Wise business account, you can send CNY to a business recipient with a CNY business account based in Mainland China. 

Make sure the recipient account is a CNY account, otherwise CNY payments will be rejected.

### How much can I send?

There's no limit on the amount of CNY and the number of payments you can send to your recipient. 

But depending on which currency you're sending money from, there may be limits for the amount you send, or how many payments you can send.

### I gave the wrong recipient name, bank account number, and/or address. What should I do?

Wrong recipient details means the recipient won't get the money. The money will be refunded to you. Refund time depends on your recipient’s bank.

### What should I choose for transfer reason?

We have to comply with Chinese regulations, so the transfer reasons for business recipients are:

  * Pay for goods

  * Pay for services

  * Investments

  * Other business expenses




### Why was my transfer rejected?

Your transfer may be cancelled for many reasons:

  * Your recipient’s bank account is not denominated in CNY

  * The name of the recipient doesn't fully match the account name on the China bank account 

  * Your recipient’s bank needs more documents to support this transfer

  * You may be sending money from an unsupported country or currency
