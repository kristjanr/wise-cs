## What do I need to do to get my Wise card in the US?  
Once you order your US Wise card online or in the app, you’ll have to complete a few more steps before we can send it to you. This is to keep you and your account safe.

### 1\. We need to verify your social security number and ID 

Like your bank, Wise is a regulated financial institution. To comply with local regulations (the USA Patriot Act) and our banking partner agreements, we need to verify the identity of any of our customers who want to order a debit card in the US. When you order your card, we’ll ask for your social security number (SSN) and an ID document. We use these only for identity verification purposes. We won’t run a credit check or sell your information to third parties. Learn more about social security verification.

 **What if I don’t have an SSN?**

If you’re not a US citizen but want to order the US card, we need to verify your identity with an ID document issued outside of the US, as well as a proof of address that’s under 1 year old. Learn more about what other ID documents we can accept. **What if I don’t have my documents with me right now?**

If you don’t have your documents with you when ordering your card, you can leave the verification step and come back later. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to send us these documents and pay for your card before we can ship it to you. 

**What if my Wise account is already verified?**

If your account was verified with Wise, we may still need to reconfirm that your personal details are correct and up to date before we can issue your card. 

We’ll ask for an ID and proof of address to make sure that your ID document is valid at the time you order your card, and that you’ve lived in the US within the past year. If we need either of these to verify your account, you’ll be prompted to upload them when you order your card.

### 2\. You need to pay for your card

It costs 9 USD to get the card. You can pay this with a different currency, but there will be a small conversion fee. 

### 3\. You’ll get an email when your card is on its way

Once you’ve uploaded your documents and paid for the card, we’ll let you know by email. Your order will say Pending until your payment goes through and we verify you. When both things are completed, we’ll ship your card. Once shipped, you’ll get it within 5–9 business days. 

### 4\. You need to activate your card

Once you’ve got your card, you’ll need to activate it before you can use it. You can only activate the card when you’re in the US, so if you’re planning to take it traveling, please make sure to activate it before you go. To activate your card: 

  1. Go to your Wise account

  2. If you’re on the website, go to Debit card. If you’re on the app, go to Account, then click the card icon at the top of the screen

  3. Enter the 6-digit code that’s on the card below your name




Now your card is activated, you’ll be able to make payments.
