We need to verify your identity before you can make a transfer in Philippine Pesos. Itâ€™s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations. 

When you set up your first transfer from PHP, our agents will get in touch with you to send in your identification documents via email. Depending on your nationality, we might also ask for your visa document. 

After sending us your documents, please give us up to 3 working days to verify them. 

**Which ID documents do we accept?**

If you're a Filipino national, we can accept a scanned copy of these ID documents:

  * PhilySis 

  * Driving licence 

  * Postal ID 

  * Passport




If you're not a Filipino national, we can **only accept your passport**.
