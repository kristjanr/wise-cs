 **Is there any other information I need to know?**

Due to South African regulations, when receiving money from abroad, both personal and business recipients need to fill out a form called a mandate. This is used to send a report to the South African Reserve Bank. 

Because of this, one of our South African partners, Exchange4Free or Sikhona Money Transfers, will email or send an SMS to your recipient with a link to this form. 

If the information isn’t provided on time, the bank may reject the payment. If this happens, we’ll let you know.

We can't send ZAR to Namibia.

*For Exchange4Free, if your recipient fills in the form before 1:00 PM South Africa time (SAST) — your transfer will arrive to your recipient at 7:00 PM the same day. Otherwise, it will arrive the next day.

*We are still in the beta phase with Sikhona Money Transfers. If your payment is sent via Sikhona, your transfer will arrive to your recipient approximately 30 minutes after they have filled out the form. 

For payments to businesses, we use the SWIFT network.
