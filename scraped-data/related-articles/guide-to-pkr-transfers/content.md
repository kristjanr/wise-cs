### Sending to PKR

 **Who can I send PKR to?**

You can send PKR to any PKR-denominated bank account in Pakistan, except express accounts.

There are bank account types in Pakistan that **do not allow any IBFT credit** from any channel, or **do not allow any inward local transfers** at all. These accounts are:

  * Meezan Bank Express account

  * Allied Bank Express account




Payments sent to these account types will either be rejected instantly, or stuck with the recipient bank until we ask our partner to claim the funds back. Please avoid sending transfers to these account types using your Wise account.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need their full name and IBAN. This is 24 characters long, contains both letters and numbers, and starts with PK. 

**How much can I send?**

You can send up to 120,000 PKR per transfer.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once we receive and convert your money, it usually takes 1 working day to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.
