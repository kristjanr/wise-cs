## What is it and how does it work?

Linked Bank Account is a new payment method in Wise powered by _eGIRO_ scheme. Similar to traditional GIRO setup, Linked Bank Account enables you to authorise a company (in this case, Wise) to debit money from your bank account. 

Link your bank account to Wise. You only need to do this once. Wise will use this authorisation to debit your bank account every time you make a transfer with the “Linked Bank Account” method.

 **How to link your bank account:**

>  **1\. Set up your transfer on Wise.** Set up your transfer — choose how much you’re sending, and enter your recipient’s bank details.
> 
>  **2\. Choose “Linked Bank Account” at the payment step.** When you get to the payment step, choose “Linked Bank Account”
> 
>  **3\. Select a bank that you want to link.** Select a bank that you want to link. You should have a savings or current account in this bank.
> 
>  **4\. Login to your bank account.** We will direct you to the bank’s website/app where you need to login using username and password. 
> 
> **5\. Select your preferred account.** Make sure you have enough balance in this account to pay for your transfer.
> 
>  **6\. Set payment limit and expiry date.** Set a limit higher than your transfer amount. This limit applies per transaction, for your current and future transfers. For example, if you set SGD 5,000 as a limit that’s the maximum amount that we can debit from your account for every transfer. 
> 
> You can also set an optional expiry date for this authorisation. 
> 
> **7\. Review details and authorise.** Your bank will ask you to authorise this account linking using 2-step verification. You might be asked to approve this request on your phone or enter OTP/token number. 

That’s it! Your money is on its way!

We will notify you when your account is linked successfully. Once done, we will debit your money from your bank account and send it to your recipient.
