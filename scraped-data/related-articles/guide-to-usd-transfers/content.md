### Sending to USD

 **Who can I send USD to?**

You can send USD to any bank account in the US that accepts ACH payments or wire payments. 

You can also send USD to bank accounts outside the US using the SWIFT payment network. These payments can take up to 5 working days to arrive and may be more expensive than transfers inside the US.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need their full name, full address (we don’t accept PO boxes), bank account number, ACH or wire routing number (or ABA), and account type.

If you’re sending to an individual, please include their first and last names and use only Latin characters (a-z). There’s an 18-character limit on recipient names.

Account numbers are between 4–17 digits long. 

Routing numbers are 9 digits long. Find your recipient’s routing number

 **How much can I send?**

Up to 1 million USD per local transfer. And up to 1.6 million USD per SWIFT transfer. For transfers sent from your Wise USD currency account, you can send up to 6 million USD.

When adding money to your Wise balance, the limit is 6 million USD per transfer.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once we receive and convert your money, we’ll send it out to your recipient. 

If you sent USD to someone in the US:

  *  **ACH payments** usually take 1–3 working days to arrive in their bank account.

  *  **Wire** payments take 15 minutes to arrive in their bank account. Your recipient may be charged an additional fee by their bank for incoming wire transfers. 

  * If you sent USD to someone **outside the US** , it usually takes 1–5 working days to arrive via SWIFT.




We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

 **Is there any other information I need to know?**

You can’t send USD to brokerages or intermediary banks. We only support transfers to checking and savings accounts.

Some banks use different routing numbers for different types of transactions. So, the routing number on your recipient’s checks might not be the right number for sending a transfer.

We can’t send For Further Credit (FFC) payments. 

### Sending from USD

You can pay for a transfer by:

  * bank debit (ACH)

  * debit/credit card

  * SWIFT




You can’t pay for your transfer with bill payments, cash, or checks.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

Check the guide for the currency you’re sending to for an estimate on how long it will take to arrive in your recipient’s account after we send it out. 

**I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. The time it takes for you to get your refund depends on how you paid, 

  * Card payments take 2–10 working days

  * ACH debits take 1–3 working days

  * Local wire transfers take 1–3 working days 

  * SWIFT transfers take 2–5 working days




If you paid using ACH debit, we’ll have to wait to receive your money before we can refund it back to you.

If you paid by wire transfer or SWIFT transfer, we might need more information before sending your refund. We’ll send you an email if we do. 

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
