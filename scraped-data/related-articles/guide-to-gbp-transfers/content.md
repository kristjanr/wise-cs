### Sending to GBP

 **Who can I send GBP to?**

You can send GBP to:

  * any UK bank account connected to the Faster Payments Scheme or CHAPS. You can’t send to accounts that only support Bacs or cheque payments

  * the Channel Islands, Isle of Man, and Gibraltar, using an IBAN starting with GB

  * countries outside the UK using the SWIFT network — this might cost extra




 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need their full name, 6-digit sort code and 8-digit bank account number.

Alternatively, you can use an IBAN, which in Europe is 14–34 alphanumeric characters long.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 5 million GBP per transfer. 

Please keep in mind, if you want to send more than 1 million GBP, you’d need to transfer it from your Wise account. This means:

  1. You’ll need to open an account for the currency you want to convert from and the currency to convert to (GBP).

  2. You’ll need to add money to your source balance.

  3. You can instantly convert the money once it’s in your Wise account to GBP.




Once the conversion is done, you can simply withdraw your money from your Wise account.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once Wise receives and converts your money, it usually arrives in your recipient’s bank account on the same working day. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 5 million GBP per transfer, depending on how you pay. If you pay by card, for example, the limit is lower — but you’ll only see the option to pay by card if you’re sending less than the limit.

 **Where can I send from?**

You can send GBP from any UK bank account using Faster Payments, Bacs or CHAPS. You can’t pay by cheque or cash.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

It usually takes seconds, but rarely it can take up to 1 working day, for your money to get to Wise, depending on how you pay for your transfer. Then, we convert it and send it out. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

Check the guide for the currency you’re sending to for an estimate on how long it will take to arrive in your recipient’s account after we send it out. 

**I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. The time it takes for you to get your refund depends on how you paid, 

  * Bank transfers take up to 1 working day

  * Card payments take 2–10 working days

  * SWIFT payments take 2–5 working days




Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
