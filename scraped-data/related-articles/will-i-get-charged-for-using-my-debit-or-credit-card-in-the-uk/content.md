### Our Low cost transfer

This type of transfer is for customers who want the most from their money. 

For most people, these transfers are a bit less easy to make. They’re also slightly slower to fund, because you need to send the money to Wise as a separate transaction. 

You can do this using a manual bank transfer, or by using the money in your balances. Both these methods are inexpensive to process. On top of that, Wise doesn’t need to do extra work to speed up how quickly your money moves. As a result, we can offer Low cost transfers at a much cheaper price.

### Our Fast and easy transfer

This type of transfer is the most convenient and stress-free way to send money abroad on Wise. It’s also faster to set up — you just need to type in your card details, or use your fingerprint with Apple Pay or Google Pay. 

But processing these transactions is more expensive for businesses like Wise. With Fast and easy transfers, your money isn’t sent to Wise instantly. As a result, Wise needs to do extra work to speed it up — and that’s a costly thing to do. But this extra expense doesn’t make Wise any more profit — it simply covers the extra costs associated with this type of transfer.

### Our Advanced transfer

This type of transfer is for sending money from a GBP bank account that is not in the UK. Advanced Transfers use the SWIFT payment network — and your bank will probably charge a fee for that. This makes them an expensive way to send money.

### We’ll always strive for fair and transparent pricing 

At Wise, we aim to charge you only for what you use. So if we priced all transfers the same, people choosing the low cost way would be covering other people’s costs. We don’t believe that’s fair. 

So we offer Low cost and Fast and easy transfers at different prices. These different prices are shown transparently and upfront in our calculator.
