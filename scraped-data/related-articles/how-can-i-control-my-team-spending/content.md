## How can I control my team spending?  
Expense cards: allow any team member to get a Wise Business debit card to spend directly from your account.

Spending limits: set a daily and monthly limit for each team member. They can see their own limits when they log in but won’t be able to see any other info about your account or finances – unless you authorise them to do so.

Spending control: Admins can also manage ATM withdrawals and digital expense cards for even greater control of team spending.

Block spending: Admins can temporarily block individual team members’ spending for tighter control of the business’ cash flow.
