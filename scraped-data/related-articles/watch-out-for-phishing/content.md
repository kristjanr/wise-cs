## Watch out for phishing  
### What is phishing? 

Phishing is a type of online fraud where scammers try to convince you to hand over your personal details by posing as a legitimate and trusted company — usually by email.

### What do these emails look like? 

They’ll look very similar to the company’s legitimate emails by copying the logo, colour scheme and typeface of the company.

### What will these emails say?

They usually say that something has happened to your account — like your account has been deactivated or that you’ve won a prize

They will ask you to log in to fix this problem — **do not log in or click any links**

### Should I click any links on a phishing email?

No — don’t click these links. If you log in via their email, they can potentially steal your card details or identity

### What’s the difference between a legitimate Wise email and a fake one?

  * Wise always addresses you by the first name you entered on our website

  * If we ask you to follow a link in an email, you’ll always be directed to a website which starts with _https://wise.com_

  * Double check the spelling of this website — scammers will sometimes change one letter so the address looks very similar




If you think you’ve received a phishing email from somebody pretending to be Wise, _**get in touch**_ — we’re happy to help.
