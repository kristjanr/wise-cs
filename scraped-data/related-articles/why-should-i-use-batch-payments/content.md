## Why should I use batch payments?  
The batch payments tool allows you to create and send multiple (up to 1,000) transfers in multiple currencies with one payment — by simply uploading a file. It’s great for businesses that have recurring invoices, need to make multiple payments, in multiple currencies, at the same time, or run international payroll. 

The batch payments tool works everywhere that Wise Business does — at the same price and speed as our individual transfers.
