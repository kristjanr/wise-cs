## How do I sync my Wise activity to my accounting software?  
Bank feeds syncing is available for several accounting software globally. The software we currently support are Xero, QuickBooks, FreeAgent, FreshBooks, Wave, Sage, Oracle Netsuite, and QuickFile. However, they are not all available in every region. 

To get started, go to Manage and click ‘App Marketplace’. Choose the accounting software you'd like to sync from the list of apps. Once your accounts are connected, you can choose which currencies you automatically want synced.

If a software you’d like to connect isn’t listed, ‘Request an app’ through the link in the App Marketplace and we’ll get in touch with you if it becomes available.
