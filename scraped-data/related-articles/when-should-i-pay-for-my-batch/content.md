## When should I pay for my batch?  
We recommend that you pay for your batch as soon as you upload your file. This will help make sure that you get that day’s exchange rate. We can only send payments once you pay for every transfer in your batch, and you mark your payment as paid. 

If for some reason you can’t pay in straight away, your transfers will remain open for a few days before being automatically cancelled by our system. Keep in mind the exchange rate may expire after 24–48 hours, and after that your money will be converted using the mid-market rate. Read more on guaranteed rate here. 

### Add a refund account

You need to add your own bank account as a refund account, in case the exchange rate changes and we need to refund any of what you paid. Just add your own bank account as a recipient in your “Recipients” tab and mark it as “primary”. If you don’t do this, you won’t be able to upload the .CSV or .XLSX file. Learn more here.
