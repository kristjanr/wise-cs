## Getting verified in India  
We need to verify your identity before you make a transfer from Indian Rupee (INR). It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations.

You can send money from INR if you live in India and are a tax-paying resident.

### What documents do I need to get verified?

 **Your Indian passport or Indian driving license**

We use this document to verify that you live in India — make sure the address on your document matches the address on your Wise account. 

Your passport or driving license will remain valid until it’s expiration date. When it expires, we’ll ask you for a new one. 

We can’t accept Aadhar cards, utility bills, bank statements, or any other Indian documents to prove your identity and address. 

**Your PAN number**

We use your PAN number to verify that you’re a tax-paying resident. 

### What do I do if the name on my Wise account doesn’t match my PAN card? 

The names on your PAN card, ID, and Wise account should match. If they don’t, we’ll need to see either a marriage license, voter ID, or affidavit to confirm your identity.
