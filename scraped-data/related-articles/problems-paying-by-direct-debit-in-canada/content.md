### I get an error when I log in to my bank account

Make sure you’re entering the right login details for that account. If you need to manage your login details for your bank, you’ll need to contact them directly.

If you’re sure you’re using the right login details, it could be that your bank doesn’t support online access. If this is the case, you’ll have to choose another payment method.

### I don’t want to provide my online banking login details

Without your login details, we can’t debit your bank account and you’ll need to pay another way. 

We’ll never pull money automatically from your account without your permission.

### I paid but the money hasn’t left my account yet

It can take a few days for the money to leave your account. Just be sure to keep enough money in your balance for the debit to work. 

### I don’t see the option to pay with direct debit 

You can send up to 9,500 CAD per day and 30,000 CAD weekly by direct debit. If your transfer puts you over the limit, you won’t be able to pay with direct debit until more time has passed. 

If you’re trying to pay from your business account, you’ll need to choose a new payment method. 

### It says I have insufficient funds, but I have enough in my account

Your bank will check all of the debits you’ve made from your account in the last 4 business days. So, if you’ve made other payments in the last few days, it might show that you have insufficient funds.

You won’t be able to pay by direct debit until the other payments clear. Try paying another way if you need to send money urgently, or wait a few business days.
