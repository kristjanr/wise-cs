## How do I verify my business in Hong Kong?  
To open a Wise Business account in Hong Kong, we need to verify your identity and your business details.To start the verification process please initiate a transfer from your business account. 

We also need to verify your personal information, so we’ll ask you to send us a photo of your ID document and in some cases a selfie.

Currently, we’re unable to support trust, charity and non-profit organisations in Hong Kong.
