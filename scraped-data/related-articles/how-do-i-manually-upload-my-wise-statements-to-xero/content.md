## How do I manually upload my Wise statements to Xero?  
When you connect your Wise business account to your Xero account, you no longer need to manually upload your Wise statements to Xero. Check that **Bank feeds sync** is turned on from your Connection settings. All activity **from the day** you connect onwards will automatically sync every 4 hours.

If you want to sync transactions from before the day you connected, go to **Sync options and status** from your _Connection settings_. You’ll see the option to choose an earlier start date — up to one year.

If you want to sync transactions that date further back than one year, you can manually upload your older Wise statements. Download a statement in PDF or CSV format for every currency you have activated or hold a Wise balance in. Then follow these instructions on how to _import statements to Xero_ and how to _reconcile your accounts_.
