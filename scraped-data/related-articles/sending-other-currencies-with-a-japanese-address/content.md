## Sending other currencies with a Japanese address  
**First, you would need to add money through Wise.** Here's how. 

  1. Go to the currency account you’d like to add money to

  2. Click **Add**

  3. Choose how much you want to add and the currency you’d like to pay with

  4. Select how you’d like to pay, and click **Continue** to payment

  5. Depending on how you’d like to pay, you’ll be guided through the payment steps




If you’re using this method to add money, the money has to come from a bank account that matches the name on your Wise account. So, if you have a Wise account for your business, the bank account you add money from has to be under the business name. 

You can’t add money in any of these currencies: AED, BDT, CLP, CRC, EGP, HKD, GEL, IDR, ILS, INR, KES, MXN, LKR, NGN, NPR, MAD, PEN, PHP, PKR, RUB, THB, UAH, VND, ZAR, and CNY. If you want to hold them, add money from your bank account and then convert to these currencies. 

**After adding money to your balance, you can send money from there**. Here's how. 

  1. Go to Home

  2. Choose the balance that you’d like to send from — on web you’ll see your balances on the left-hand side of the screen, on the app they’re at the top of the screen

  3. Click on Send 

  4. Enter the amount you want to send, choose a recipient and enter a reference




If you live in Japan, you can send up to 1 million JPY **per transfer**. If you're sending from other currencies, the amount should be equivalent to 1 million JPY. There's no limit on how many transfers you can make.
