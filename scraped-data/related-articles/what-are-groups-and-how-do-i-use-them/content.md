## What are Groups and how do I use them?  
Groups give you control over how you separate your funds and manage your team members' access to spend from those funds. Money in Groups is kept separately from your main balances.

As a business owner or admin, you can use Groups for anything that you’d like to separate funds and manage team expenses for. Once you create a Group, you can add the employees who can order cards and spend from it. You can use Groups to:

  * separate expenses for teams in your company

  * create a pool of money for an event for your team to spend from

  * separate money to pay specific suppliers

  * manage controls and permissions for members to spend from specific Groups




You can also hold multiple currencies and spend from them within each Group. 

### **How is a group different from a main currency balance or Jar?**

By default, money that you’ve added to your business accounts are held in the main _balances_, separated by currencies. You have one main balance per currency. All team members added to your business account with an “employee” role can order cards and spend from the main currency balance.

Jars is where business owners and admins can set aside money for specific purposes. It’s kept separate from the balance of that currency. Team members can't spend from Jars.

Groups is where business owners and admins can separate funds and manage team expenses. As an admin, you can create multiple Groups and hold multiple currencies within each Group. You can add team members with the employee role to Groups, so they can order cards and spend from them.

###  **How can I open a** Group **?**

Only team members with the owner or admin roles can open Groups.

As an admin, you can open a Group by:

  1. logging in to Wise and clicking on "Open 50+ currencies" on the homepage. You'll see the option to open a Balance, Group or Jar

  2. click on "Group" and provide the name of the Group. This is usually what your team would use it for and the currency you’d like to use the Group in. You can also export statements for specific Groups.




### How can I rename or close an existing Group?

Currently, you cannot rename or close existing Groups. We're working on making this possible.

###  **How can I add more currencies to an existing** Group **?**

You can do so by adding new Balances to your existing Group:

  * Choose the Group you’d like to add a new balance to 

  * Choose the **balances** tab

  * Click on **Add balance** and choose the currency you’d like to add




###  **How can team members be added to** Groups **?**

Team members must be added to the company’s business account with the role "employee" before they can be added to Groups.

###  **How can I add and withdraw money from** Groups **?**

Admins can add money to a Group by moving money from the business account’s existing balances. You can add money from a balance of the same currency to a Group of the same currency for free. (For example, it's free to move money from your GBP balance to a Group in GBP for Marketing.)

If you add money from a Balance to a Group of a different currency, the usual conversion fee will apply.

To withdraw money from Group, you can only move money to the main currency balance, and it’s free to do so. 

Currently, it’s not possible to convert money between balances within the Group.

###  **How many cards can employees order for each** Group **?**

Each user with employee role can order up to three digital cards across all Groups. This means that everyone can only have a maximum of three digital cards across all Groups.

(To get digital cards under new Groups which have been created, you’d need to delete any digital cards you may not need to use anymore.)

###  **How do spending limits apply within a** Group **?**

Spending limits apply on a user level, not a card or Group level. When an admin invites a team member to join the company’s business account as an employee, they set the spending limit for the team member.

This limit applies to the employee across all cards they have. Currently, it’s not possible to set spending limits on a card or Group level. If you’re an admin and would like to change an employee’s spending limits, you can do so on the Team page.

###  **How can I see all the cards linked to a** Groups **?**

If you’re a business owner or admin, you’d be able to see all cards linked to a Group under the **Cards** tab.

If you’re an employee, you can only see your own cards in each Groups or an overview of all your cards with the corresponding Groups name in the main card page. You cannot see the card details of other team members.

###  **What happens when a team member leaves the company?**

When a team member leaves the company, the business account owner or admin can remove them from the business account. By doing so, the team member (whether they are an admin or employee) will also be removed from all Groups they were added to. All cards associated with the relevant team members will be blocked and removed from Groups and the business account. This can't be undone.

###  **What happens when a team member’s role is changed from an admin to an employee?**

When this happens, any cards tied to any existing Groups can still be used normally. The team member will still be able to use their digital cards that are tagged to existing Groups.

However, since they are no longer an admin, they will only see their own card details and transaction details. They will no longer be able to perform the role of an admin within the Groups, such as managing money and members.

###  **What happens when a team member’s role is changed from an employee to an admin?**

When this happens, any cards tied to any existing Groups can still be used normally. With the new admin role, the team member will now be able to perform additional roles of an admin within Groups, such as seeing all Groups for the business account, managing money, and managing members within the Groups.

###  **Are there any instances where a team member may not be able to use a** Groups **?**

If a team member’s Wise profile is suspended by Wise for any reason, their cards will be blocked and they won’t be able to spend from your business account. If this happens, please get in touch.
