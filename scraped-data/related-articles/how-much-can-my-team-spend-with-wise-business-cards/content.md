## How much can my team spend with Wise Business cards?  
Spending limits for all team members are linked to the limits for the business account.

That means that if you allow any team member to get a debit card on your account and they spend with it, that spending will count towards the business account limit.

For example, if one team member withdraws 1500 GBP on a given day, hitting the daily limit for ATM withdrawals, other team members won’t be able to withdraw more money from the business account until the limit refreshes at midnight.

Admins will be able to see how much the business has left of its daily, monthly and per transaction limits.

Employees can see their own limits and they won’t be able to see any sensitive info or business spending on your Wise account.

Different limits apply to different businesses, based on the region where they're registered.
