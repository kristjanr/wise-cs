## I'm expecting money, but it hasn't arrived yet  
If you’re waiting for money that someone has sent you through Wise, the best way to check where it is, is to ask the person who sent it. They can check its status by logging in to their Wise account.

If you’d like to talk to our support team and you’re a recipient, we unfortunately won’t be able to give you any specific details. This is for privacy and security reasons — we can only give information about a transfer to the person who sent it.

### What if Wise already sent out the money? 

Here’s what to do if Wise has already sent the money, but it’s not in your account yet.

 **1\. Check our** **Currencies** **articles for the currency you’re receiving.**

Once Wise has sent the money out, it can take time for your bank to process it. If you’re receiving EUR, for example, it can take 1–2 working days before the money settles in your account. Check the article for your currency to find out how much longer it might take.

 **2\. Ask the sender for a transfer receipt.**

If you’ve been waiting longer than the delivery time for your currency, ask the sender for a transfer receipt. They can find this by going to the relevant transfer in the Activity section of their Wise account, clicking View transfer details, then Get PDF receipt.

Send the PDF to us. Highlight the banking partner reference and name on the second page. We can use this number to speed up the process.

 **3\. Check your bank details.**

When you get the transfer receipt, check your bank details to make sure the sender didn’t make a mistake. If they did, let them know and ask them to follow these instructions on how they can fix it.

### What if haven't received the money I'm expecting from an external bank account?

If you haven’t got the money within the timeframe specified for your currency, first check with the sender whether they used the correct account details.

If you’d like us to take a look, please send us a proof of payment so we can check it. This can be a receipt, bank statement, or a screenshot from an online bank showing:

  * sender’s name and account details

  * your name and account details

  * date they sent the money

  * amount they sent




We need to see all the above information in the one screenshot or document to be able to look into your problem.
