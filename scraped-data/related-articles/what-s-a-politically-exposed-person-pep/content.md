## What's a Politically Exposed Person (PEP)?  
As a regulated financial institution, sometimes we need to confirm some details about you before we can complete your transfer. We’ll need to know if you’re a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or connected to someone who is.

### How do I know if I’m a PEP?

A PEP is someone who is, or was, in a position to influence politics or make significant economic or financial decisions.

If you are, or ever were, one of the following, you’re probably a PEP:

  * head of state, head of government, minister, and deputy or assistant minister

  * member of parliament, or of similar legislative bodies

  * member of the governing bodies of political parties

  * member of supreme courts, of constitutional courts, or of other high-level judicial bodies whose decisions are not generally subject to further appeal, other than in exceptional circumstances 

  * member of courts of auditors, or of the boards of central banks

  * ambassador as well as other heads of diplomatic missions (i.a. councils), chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces

  * member of the administrative, management, or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises 

  * director, deputy director, and member of the board or equivalent function of an international organisation

  * person entrusted with a prominent function by the European Union, or another international organisation (members of senior management, or individuals entrusted with equivalent functions) 

  * any other individual in senior positions holding prominent public functions who have the ability to influence politics, or make significant economic or financial decisions




 **Keep in mind: we may decide to consider you a PEP based on your specific position and our regulatory requirements, even if it's not mentioned on the above list.**

### How do I know if I’m connected to a PEP?

Our rule of thumb is if you think you’re connected to a PEP, you are.

We typically consider you connected to a PEP if you’re related to them, or work with them. Here are some general guidelines:

  * you’re their spouse, or civil partner

  * you’re their child

  * you’re their child’s spouse or civil partner

  * you’re their parent

  * you’re their sibling

  * you have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity, or a legal arrangement, or any other close business relationship with a PEP

  * you have sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity, or a legal arrangement that is set up for the benefit of a PEP




###  **What happens once I've been identified as a PEP?**

We’ll review your account according to the regulatory requirements. We may get in touch to ask for more information and documents — for example, your proof of income, tax returns, and bank statements.

###  **If I'm no longer in the PEP position, am I still a PEP?**

Your PEP status doesn't expire immediately after you leave the PEP position. Different regulations apply, depending on your region and the PEP position you held. 

### **When does my PEP title expire?**

The expiration period starts from the day you leave the PEP position. It'll apply again if you assume another PEP position.
