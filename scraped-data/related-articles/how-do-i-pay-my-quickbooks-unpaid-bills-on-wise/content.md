## How do I pay my QuickBooks unpaid bills on Wise?  
First, select the Bills tab.

  * If your bills are already synced, then you’ll see a list of unpaid bills from QuickBooks. These will be synced automatically. From the Bills tab, you can pay the bill like you’d normally send money. 

  * If you do not have the bills connection switched on then you will have to follow the steps below to connect Wise to QuickBooks:



  1. Go to the Wise App Marketplace in Account

  2. Find the QuickBooks logo 

  3. Turn on **Import bills**
