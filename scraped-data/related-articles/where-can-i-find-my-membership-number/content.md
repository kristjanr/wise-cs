## Where can I find my membership number?  
Your membership number is a unique identifier we give you when you create an account with us. It is a line of numbers, and it starts with the letter P. 

#### Here is how to find it on the website

  1. Log in to your account on the Wise website

  2. Click on your full name on the top right corner

  3. Your membership number is displayed under your full name




#### On the app

  1. Go to "Home" on the bottom left corner (this is the screen we show you when you first log on to the application)

  2. Click on your initials at the top left corner (if you set up a profile picture, you will see that instead of your initials)

  3. Your membership number is displayed on the bottom of the screen




#### What can I use this number for? 

You will need to use this number when you pay for a transfer via the _low cost transfer_ payment method. With this method, you transfer the money to Wise from your external bank account, and we need you to include your membership number as a reference when sending us the funds. This helps us locate your money and to make sure it came from you.

We also ask for your membership number when you reach out to us over the phone.
