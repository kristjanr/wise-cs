You can use Interac e-Transfer Request Money to send Canadian dollars (CAD) to your Wise account and to fund your international transfers.

 _Guide to CAD transfers_

Although the steps may vary from bank to bank, sending CAD with Interac e-Transfer is usually a fairly easy process.

You’ll just need to set up your transfer, and choose Interac e-Transfer Request Money as the preferred pay-in method. Then, follow these steps:

  1. Enter the email address that you usually use with Interac e-Transfers and confirm. You can also use your phone number.

  2. Wise will send you an Interac e-Transfer Request Money for the exact amount of your transfer, including fees. 

  3. You’ll receive an email, or a text from Interac asking you to confirm that request.

  4. Go to your email and follow the instructions (the request may take a minute to appear):

    * Log in to your bank's website or app

    * Navigate to your Interac e-Transfer section

    * Review the amount and transfer details

    * Confirm the request

  5. You’re all done — wait for confirmation




We'll notify you once the money arrives through Interac e-Transfer.

 **My Interac link has expired. What can I do?**

The Interac link we sent you to request money expires after 24 hours. You can find your transfer in your activity feed and click on Choose how to pay. You will be able to select Interac again and send a new request.

 **How long does it take for my money to arrive?**

The request we send you over email or text (if you shared your phone number when creating the request) usually takes a couple of minutes to arrive. This may take a bit longer depending on your network provider.

Once you approve the Interac e-Transfer request, it usually takes a few minutes to arrive. It may take longer depending on your bank.

 **Why is there a fee? I thought Interac was free.**

Like every payment method, it's not free. Your bank usually lifts those fees for a limited amount of payments. Wise’s mission of transparency is to charge the real cost of the payments you use. The other side of Wise’s mission is to lower costs, including the ones you pay for Interac e-Transfers.
