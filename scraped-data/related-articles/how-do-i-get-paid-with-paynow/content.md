## How do I get paid with PayNow?  
Share your PayNow QR code or the Unique Entity Number (UEN) and your reference with your friends, company or customers, so they can send you SGD from any app supporting PayNow, instantaneously and with zero fees.

###  **Where do I find my PayNow details**

  1. Log in to your Wise account on the website

  2. Click on your **SGD Balance**

  3. Click on **Receive** , to the right of your balance amount

  4. Select **Get PayNow QR Code**

  5. Download your **QR code** or select **Copy details** to use the UEN and your reference




###  **Things you should know**

  * Your PayNow reference is unique to you, so make sure you share it to your senders without mistakes.

  * Your payer will see “Wise Asia-Pacific Pte. Ltd.” as the recipient as Wise collects payments on your behalf.




###  **Limitations**

Your PayNow details can only be used to receive up to 200,000 SGD per transfer, but there’s no limit on how many transfers you can receive per day.

If your Wise account address is in Singapore:

  * For personal accounts, you can't hold more than the equivalent of 5,000 SGD at the end of the day, midnight SGT. This is because we are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) under the _Payment Services Act_.

  * For Business accounts, there is no limit to how much you can hold.




###  **What to do when a payment doesn’t arrive**

Payments made by scanning the QR code will be credited to your balance shortly after the payment is made.

For payments made by entering the Unique Entity Number (UEN) and your Reference, your payer must include the correct reference for us to credit your balance. If they made an error, ask them to send you a proof of payment showing the details they used to send money. Click here to upload the document under **Waiting for money to arrive in my balance**.
