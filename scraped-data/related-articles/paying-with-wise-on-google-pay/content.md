## Paying with Wise on Google Pay  
If you live in the US, you can now use the Google Pay app (GPay) to send money to friends and family in India — powered by Wise.

We’ve partnered with Google to bring the experience of Wise right into GPay, so you won’t have to leave Google Pay to send your international money transfer. 

### Using Wise for the first time

We make international money transfers cheaper, faster, and more transparent — so if you’re using us for the first time, welcome to stressing less. 

The first time you use Wise through GPay, you’ll need to create an account with us. We'll just ask for the basics, like your name, date of birth, and address. 

Once you’ve created an account, we connect it with GPay and you can start sending money. 

If you already have a Wise account, connect it to GPay using the email address and password you have registered with us. 

### Paying with Wise on GPay

It’s easy to use Wise on GPay to send money internationally — here’s how:

  1. Open GPay 

  2. Tap **Send or request.**

    * Search or tap the contact in India with a (+91 phone number) who you want to send money to. You can send money with a phone number or email. Your friend or family member needs to download the Google Pay app to be eligible to receive money.

  3. Tap **Pay**. 

  4. Select the amount of money you want to transfer. We'll show you the current exchange rate and any fees related to your transaction. 

  5. Tap **Continue.**

  6. If you don’t already have a Wise account, you’ll be directed to create one.

  7. Enter your information, then tap **Create Wise account**.

  8. Enter recipient details:

    * Full name of recipient

    * Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) number

    * Bank account number

  9. Select your payment method and tap **Continue**. 

  10. Review the transfer information and tap **Start transfer**. 




### Are there any restrictions?

Right now, you can only pay with Wise on GPay from the US to India via INR. You’ll be shown Wise as a payment option if your recipient’s phone number starts with +91. 

The most you can send with Wise on GPay is 2,000 USD per payment and 8,000 USD per week.

### Unlink your Wise account from Google Pay

  1. Open GPay.

  2. At the top right, tap your profile picture.

  3. Tap **Settings** > **Privacy & security **> **Data & personalization.**

  4. Under “Linking Google Pay for international money transfers”, tap **View and manage linking > Unlink**. 




### Check the status of your transfer from Google Pay

  1. Open the GPay.

  2. Select the contact you transferred money to.

  3. On the payment confirmation, tap **Check Status**.

  4. The status will be one of the following:

    *  **Pending** : The payment's in process with our partner, or sender info is being confirmed. If the transfer has been on hold for longer than 1 day, there are likely additional checks being carried out. Read more about these checks here and be sure to check for any emails from Wise. We might need more information from you. 

    * **Completed** : The transaction is complete. Transactions are usually instant. 

    * **Cancelled** : The transaction was cancelled. If you didn't initiate the cancellation, you can read more about why it may have been cancelled _here_. 




If the recipient needs confirmation of the transfer, you can share a screenshot of the confirmation or a downloadable receipt. You can find a downloadable receipt in the transaction details in GPay. This receipt can also help the beneficiary bank track the transfer if it hasn’t arrived within the expected time.

To find your international transfer transaction details, open GPay and select **Activity**. Tap on the transaction you'd like more information about.

###  **Can I cancel the transfer?**

If the transfer hasn’t been completed and sent out, you can still cancel the transfer. To cancel the transfer, you would need to log in directly to Wise and follow the steps below:

  1. Go to Home to see your activity list.

  2. Find the pending transfer you want to cancel.

  3. Click **Cancel transfer**. On Android, you’ll find this by clicking the 3 dots at the top right corner of the transfer page.

  4. Select **I paid** > **Cancel transfer.**




###  **I got my recipient's bank details wrong**

Everyone makes mistakes. The fastest way to fix this one is by cancelling the transfer yourself. You can then set up a new transfer using the correct bank details. Whether or not you can cancel depends on how far along your transfer is in our system. So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.

  1. Log in to your Wise account.

  2. Go to **Home** to see your activity list.

  3. Find the transfer in question — it should be marked as **pending.**




If your transfer’s set up, your money’s on its way to us, or your money’s being processed, you should still be able to cancel your transfer. We’ll send the money back to you, and you can set up another transfer using the correct bank details. Anything after those 3 stages can’t be cancelled.
