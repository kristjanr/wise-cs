## What are the different batch template options?  
There are multiple batch payment templates to choose from, so just use the one that works for you.

######  **Send by email template**

If you don’t know the bank details of your recipients, you can add their email addresses to the template. Just add their email addresses to the template, along with the transfer amount and currency. We’ll send each a secure link so they can provide their bank details. Make sure there’s a column for ”recipientEmail”. If you need to send money to multiple currencies, there’s a way to do that, too.

When you use the send by email template, your recipients will have 1 week to enter their details before the link expires. After this point, we’ll cancel and refund the payment. 

###### **Send to saved recipients template**

If you’ve used Wise before, your recipients are automatically saved. For this template, we add all the details of all your saved recipients automatically — the details will be filled in when you download the file. You can see all your recipients in the Recipients section here. Once you’ve downloaded the template, you may delete anyone from the file that you don’t want included in the batch payment.

Remember: you can’t send money to new recipients with this template.

######  **Send to bank account template**

This template allows you to manually add recipient bank and transfer details. You can send money to one or multiple currencies with this template. All recipients you pay to with the file will automatically be saved in your list of recipients.
