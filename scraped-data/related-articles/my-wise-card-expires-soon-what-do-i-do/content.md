### Will my current card still work until I get the new one?

Yes, your current card will work until the last day of the month it expires. You can order a new card up to 6 month before it expires.

### Activation

Your card will already be activated when it arrives (except for US issued cards), and can be used immediately with online, and mobile wallet purchases.

You must _**activate your card**_ on the Wise app or website to unlock all other payment methods.

### Updating your card details

Once your new card is activated, make sure to remove your old card from mobile wallets and add the new one. Don’t forget to update your new card information with any merchants or subscriptions you pay using your Wise card.
