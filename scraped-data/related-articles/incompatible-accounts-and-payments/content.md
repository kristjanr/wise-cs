## Incompatible accounts and payments  
When you send money to Wise — either by paying for a transfer, adding money, or sending to another Wise user — there are some types of accounts or payments we can't accept. 

### Types of accounts we can't accept money from

 **Brokerage**

You can pay for a transfer from USD brokerage accounts, but only if the money is sent from an account in your name — we might ask for a document that proves you own the account. 

**Stripe**

You can receive money from Stripe into your Wise account. But you can't pay for a transfer, or add money from Stripe. 

**PayPal**

If PayPal accepts your Wise account details as a withdrawal bank account, you can receive money from your PayPal account. You may be able to also use PayPal to pay for a transfer, or add money.

 **Accounts that show the account holder as a third party**

If you're paying for a transfer, or adding money to your Wise account, the money must come from an account in your name. If the account holder is a third party, we can't accept the money. Some accounts like this are: 

  * Estate accounts

  * Skrill accounts

  * Contis Group accounts

  * Card One accounts




### Types of payments we can't accept

We never accept cash, cheques, or any cryptocurrency (crypto). 

You can receive money to your Wise account from a platform that deals with cryptocurrencies — as long as the platform is regulated and/or supervised in the EU or UK.
