## How do I mark a primary account to receive money into?  
If someone is sending you money using Wise, you don’t have to share your bank details with them. You can set a primary account to receive money into, or have them find you. Then, just give them the email address you registered with Wise. 

On your Recipients page, next to your bank accounts, you can select **Mark as primary account**. If you haven’t added your bank details before, select **Add your bank account.**

If you want to receive money into an AUD or USD account, the primary account details must have the address entered.
