## Applying for advice from Yes Bank  
### How to request an e-FIRC

If your transfer was received via Yes Bank, you can request an e-FIRC. To do this:

 **1\. Pay YES BANK 354 INR for FIRC issuance charges.** There are 2 options to pay:

  * By NEFT to their bank details below: Account number: 105051718 IFSC: YESB0000001

  * Or by demand draft to YES BANK Ltd, using this address: YES BANK Ltd Inward Remittance Team, 5th floor, Tower 2, India-bulls Finance Centre, Prabhadevi (West), Mumbai - 400013




Keep note of the reference number, as you’ll need to send it to YES BANK.

 **2\. Send an email to** **dlmumfirc@yesbank.in** **with the subject “Request for FIRC advice”**

In the email, you’ll need to include the Inward Remittance Transaction details, a valid purpose code for the transaction, an NOC from the beneficiary bank (unless the payment is through YES BANK), and the transaction reference number for the FIRC issuance charges you paid. You’ll also need to attach the Wise receipt to your email.

 **3\. YES BANK will then verify the details and send the beneficiary the FIRC advice.**

It can take up to 7–10 days, as long as you’ve completed the steps above correctly. If you don’t follow the steps exactly, there can be delays in getting the FIRC advice.

Please don’t courier documents to YES BANK offices or visit their branches in person to make a FIRC request.

### Important to note

Export, import, trade, and business-related transfers to India are regulated under strict guidelines from the RBI and FEDAI. Please review these guidelines closely to better understand whether a FIRC can be issued for your transfer.

Remember that FDI transfers are not allowed under RDA. So, please don’t submit FIRC requests about FDI transfers using a different purpose code.
