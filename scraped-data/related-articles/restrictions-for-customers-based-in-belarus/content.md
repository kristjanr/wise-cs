## Restrictions for Customers based in Belarus  
We’re not able to serve customers in Belarus at the moment. This means we’re closing all Wise accounts with addresses registered in Belarus on 27 May 2022. Here’s what will happen, and what you need to do.

 **1\. You will only be able to withdraw money from your account**

From 25 March 2022, you’ll only be able to withdraw money from your Wise account and no longer be able to add money to your Wise account.This means:

  * If you hold EUR or USD or other supported currencies, you can only send those funds to an account outside of Belarus

  * Any receipts or top-ups to your account will be rejected and sent back to the sender.




 **2\. Move all money out of your Wise account within 60 days.**

We'll close Wise accounts of customers in Belarus on 27 May, 2022. This means you have to move money out of your Wise account (across all currencies), and download any important information.

 **Why is this happening?**

The impact of ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region mean it’s getting increasingly difficult for us to operate in Belarus. This may mean it becomes more difficult or even impossible for you to access services like Wise or withdraw your money in the future.

We know this is a very difficult situation — and we’re so sorry. If you have any questions, our support team is here to help.
