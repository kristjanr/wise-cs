####  **Things you should know**

  * You must send funds from your own bank account. We can’t accept money coming from an account that isn’t under your name. You can receive money from others using your SGD account details.

  * Each PayNow QR Code is unique to the transfer you have set up. Don’t share the code with others.

  * You’ll see “Wise Asia-Pacific Pte. Ltd” as the recipient on your bank account — this is because Wise collects the payment. 

  * You can send up to 200,000 SGD per transfer. There’s no limit on how many transfers you can send. See our Terms and Conditions for more information.
