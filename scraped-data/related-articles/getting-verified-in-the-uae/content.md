## Getting verified in the UAE  
We need to verify your identity before you make a transfer from Emirati Dirhams (AED). It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations.

We’ll **always** ask for 2 types of documents when you set up and fund your first transfer from AED:

  * Your ID document 

  * A selfie with ID 




We might also ask for a proof of address from you too. 

### What documents can I use for my ID? 

We can **only** accept these documents to verify your identity: 

  * Passport (photo page only) 

  * Emirates ID 




We can’t make any exceptions, and in some cases, we’ll need both — so be sure to have both documents ready. 

### How does selfie verification work?

For transfers from AED, we require a selfie with ID. This means uploading a picture of yourself (a selfie) while holding your ID.

### What documents can I use for my proof of address?

Your address must always be a residential address, but you don’t need to live in the UAE to pay for a transfer from AED. If you live in the UAE, we can’t accept some documents you’d typically use. 

We **can** accept these documents to verify your address:

  * Tenancy contract or agreement; we need to see the full copy, including signatures of both parties

  * Bank statement

  * Local authority tax bill

  * Driving license with address on it 

  * Utility bill (e.g. electricity, water, telecommunications)

  * Letter by employer or employment contract (should not be more than one month old)




We **can’t** accept these documents to verify your address:

  * UAE driving licenses; these licenses don’t show addresses

  * PO boxes

  * Documents in non-Latin text




Your proof of address should show:

  *  **Your name and address:** matching the information your Wise account 

  * **Date of issue**

  *  **A logo, or clear name of the sender:** like your bank, your local authority, your utilities provider, etc

  *  **The nature of the document:** like the type of bill, subject of the letter, etc
