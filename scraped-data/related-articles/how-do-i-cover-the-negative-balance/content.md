## How do I cover the negative balance?  
**What’s happening?**

Your direct debit payment to us failed. Before we received a debit failure notification, we cleared the funds to your currency account. After the payment failed, the funds were automatically pulled back from your currency account, making it go negative as you already withdrew the available balance. 

Keep in mind, you won’t be able to make and fund future transfers until your negative balance is covered. 

To get a better understanding of the money movement in your currency account, please download the currency account statement. 

### **My transfer was cancelled, why do I need to pay you?**

Although your transfer was cancelled, you still initiated the payment, so instead we had to go ahead and issue the refund to you.

After we issued the refund to you, we received a notification your debit wasn’t successful — so we withdrew the funds from your account, making it go negative. 

### **How do I repay the negative balance?**

To cover the negative balance, please add money to your account by following the instructions from the Add money page.

Depending on the failure reason, you may not currently have the debit payment option available. If you wish to pay via direct debit again, please consult with your bank first to ensure no further restrictions are in place and reach out to us for confirmation. 

You can add money to any available currency we offer and it will go automatically towards covering the negative currency balance. 

### **What if I was scammed by my recipient?**

After getting in touch with us, you’ll still need to cover the negative balance as you had originally authorised and agreed to the payment with us.
