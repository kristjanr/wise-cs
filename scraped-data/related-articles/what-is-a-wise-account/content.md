## What is a Wise Account?  
With Wise, you can hold money in 50+ currencies, and convert between them at the real exchange rate whenever you need. It’s free to sign up, and there are no monthly fees.

Learn about pricing here.

You can get account details for USD, GBP, EUR, AUD*, NZD, CAD, HUF, RON**, and SGD — with more currencies on the way. Share these details with your friends, companies or customers to get money from around the world. You can also receive money without sharing your bank details.

You can send money from your Wise balance to a bank account outside of Wise whenever you like. We’ll charge a fixed fee and a conversion fee when you send to a different currency. Sending and receiving money between Wise Accounts in the same currency is free. 

You can spend money in different currencies around the world with the Wise card and get low conversion fees — check this on our pricing page. For the most up-to-date pricing and fee information, please read our Terms of Use for your region.

###  **How do I open a Wise Account?**

You’ll have to register and create an account with Wise. 

Just share your email address, create a password, choose if you want to open a **personal** or **business** account, share your phone number for 2-step verification, and tell us the country you live in.

For your **personal account** , sign up with your legal name, date of birth and address. 

For your **business account** , we'll need your business tax identification number, and your business registration address. 

Wise may request additional documents to verify your identity or business. 

### **Can I have multiple Wise accounts?**

No, you can only have one personal Wise account.

You'll need to open separate Wise business accounts for every different legal entity.

###  **What’s the difference between my personal account and my business account?**

A **personal account** should only be used for personal transactions.

A **business account** should only be used for business transactions, even if you're a freelancer or a sole proprietor. 

### **How can I hold money in my Wise account?**

Once you've set up your personal and business account(s), you can get started on a Wise Account where you can hold over 50 currencies. Just click on Open a balance, and follow the instructions.

###  **Can I hold multiple currencies in my Wise account?**

Yes! You can open different balances for the different currencies.

To add money to your balance, you just need to follow the same steps to open other balances in other currencies on your Wise Account.

You can also convert currencies between your balances at the real exchange rate and at a low fee. 

### **How do I add money to my Wise Account?**

Just click Add in your balance. You’ll see different ways to add money depending on the amount, currency, and your region — like bank transfer or card payment.

###  **Does this mean I have multiple accounts with Wise?**

No, all those balances are held in your one Wise Account.

###  **I live outside the UK and have requested a balance in GBP. Does this mean I have a UK account?**

No, having a specific currency balance with Wise doesn't change your Wise account location. Wise works under several legal entities worldwide. Your registered address determines where your account is based, and what terms and conditions apply.

###  **How can I get money in my Wise Account?**

If you want to get money from third parties in a country where you don’t have your own bank account, Wise can give you your own account details for these currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, AUD*, NZD, CAD, HUF, RON**, TRY, and SGD — with more on the way. 

Account details will be different depending on the currency. You'll have an IBAN for your EUR balance, a sort code and account number for GBP, a routing and account number for USD, and so on.

Those account details are unique to you. You can share them with friends and companies to get money from globally.

###  **Can I have multiple account details?**

Yes! You can get account details for each of the 10 currencies that we offer them for. But you can only have **one** set of account details **per currency**. 

You can't get all details at the same time — you’ll need to request details for each currency separately. 

These details will be different for your personal and business account(s), so you'll need to request them separately, too.

###  **Are account details separate from my Wise account?**

Account details aren’t separate accounts — they’re a way to make a pay-in or receive money into your Wise account. That way, with just one Wise account, you can have different balances to hold money, and different account details to receive money.

 **Personal account**

Let’s say you have a family member in the US, and they want to send you money. With your Wise account, you’ll just need to share your USD account details with them. They'll be able to send you USD directly into your USD balance using those account details.

 **Business account**

Let’s say you’re a company with one customer in the UK and one in the US. You can open both USD and GBP account details in your Wise account to get paid in both currencies. All you have to do is share your USD account details with your US customer and your GBP account details with your UK customers — now they can send you money in those currencies.

###  **What about taxes on my Wise account? Should I report my account to my tax authority as foreign accounts?**

With a Wise account, you can have balances in up to 50 currencies, and they're all part of your one Wise account. That means you need to follow the reporting rules in your country for your Wise account, but not for all individual balances or currencies.*

###  **How is a Wise account different from a bank account, and how does Wise hold my money?**

You can't get an overdraft or loan.

You won't earn interest.

###  **Is there a difference between the borderless account, the multi-currency account, and the Wise account?**

No, we just changed the name, but it’s still the exact same (awesome) account.
