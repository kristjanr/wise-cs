## I can’t sign up for Wise in Myanmar  
We’re not able to serve customers in Myanmar at the moment. This means that you won’t be able to open a Wise account if your address is in Myanmar or you reside there. 

**Why is this happening?**

Unfortunately it’s getting increasingly difficult for us to operate in Myanmar so we’ll need to suspend our service.

We know this is a very difficult situation — and we’re so sorry. If you have any questions, our support team is here to help.
