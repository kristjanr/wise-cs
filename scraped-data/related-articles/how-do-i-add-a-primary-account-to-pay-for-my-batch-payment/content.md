## How do I add a primary account to pay for my batch payment?  
You simply need to go to the Recipients page, where you’ll see all your recipient details. If you haven’t previously sent money to yourself in another currency bank account, you can add one by clicking **Add new** next to **My bank accounts**.

Once you’ve added your account, you can click the arrow next to **Send money** in the account you want to nominate and you’ll see the option to **Mark as primary account**. You can then choose the associated currency of that account.
