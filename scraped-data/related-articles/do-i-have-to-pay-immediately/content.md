## Do I have to pay immediately?  
Regardless of whether you’re making a regular transfer, or adding money to your balances, we can only complete this once we’ve received your money. If you’re in a hurry, you can set it up and pay later, no problem.

If you create multiple transfers, or top-ups, for the same amount — for example 1,000 EUR — and then send us a single amount of 1,000 EUR this would be assigned to the first transfer or top-up you created (it doesn’t matter which of the two it is).

Please keep in mind that money won’t be sent to your recipient or added to your balance until we receive it from you. 

If you wait to pay, your transfer or top-up will stay open for several days before it’s cancelled. Don’t worry though — there’s no charge for this.
