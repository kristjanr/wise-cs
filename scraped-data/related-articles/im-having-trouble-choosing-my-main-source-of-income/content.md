## I’m having trouble choosing my main source of income  
Your main source of income is how you earn the majority of your money. So, if 70% of your income comes from your salary, and 30% comes from investments, choose “salary” at this step. 

If you can’t see your main source of income on the list, choose “something else”. Then, type a description of how you earn your money in the box.
