## What if I don't know my recipient's bank details?  
No problem. If you don’t know the bank details of the person you are sending money to, you can use our money to link or money to email service. This means that instead of bank details, you enter their email address. Then we send an email to them so they can enter the bank details themselves.

Once they accept the transfer and enter their details, we’ll keep you both updated on when the money is sent out by us and how soon it should reach them.

If we don’t receive the bank details within 1 week, we need to cancel your transfer and refund you.

Unfortunately, you can’t make transfers to an email address or a primary account when sending:

  * from BRL and INR

  * to LKR, PEN, BDT, COP, CNY, UAH, GHS and USD to a bank account outside of the US
