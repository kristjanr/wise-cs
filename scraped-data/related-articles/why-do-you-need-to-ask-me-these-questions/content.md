## Why do you need to ask me these questions?  
Wise is a financial institution, so we need to know who’s using our service, why they’re using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe.

We have different regulatory requirements in different regions. Because of this, we may need to ask more, or different, questions, depending on where you move money to or from, or where you live. 

We know this is personal information. So we try to ask you the least we can, to still complete all the checks. We always store your information securely, in line with our privacy policy.
