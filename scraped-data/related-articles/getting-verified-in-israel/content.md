## Getting verified in Israel  
We need to verify your identity before you make a transfer in Israeli Shekel (ILS). It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations. It usually takes up to 2-4 working days for us to verify you. 

#### **Proof of ID**

We only accept an ID issued in Israel. You should send us a high quality photo or scan of one of these documents: 

  * Israeli driving licence 

  * Israeli passport




We might ask for a secondary ID to verify your identity — this can be an ID issued in another country.
