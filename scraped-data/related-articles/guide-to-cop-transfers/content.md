 **What is Abono Automático and how does it work?**

Abono Automático is a free feature that Bancolombia offers to people who want to receive money from abroad.

Your recipient must have Abono Automático turned on to receive money. If you try to send COP to a bank account without it, you’ll get an error message. 

This is how your recipient can turn on Abono Automático:

  1. Open internet banking

  2. Go to the international transfers section

  3. Choose an account and reason for receiving money




Once they’ve done that, it takes 24 hours until they’ll be able to receive money.
