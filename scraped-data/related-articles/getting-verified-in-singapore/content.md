## Getting verified in Singapore  
We need to verify your identity before you make a transfer in Singapore dollars (SGD) or open a balance in Singapore. It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations.

 **There are 2 ways to get verified: Singpass or uploading documents.**

* * *

### How do I get verified using Singpass?

Myinfo is Singapore Government e-service that allows Singpass (Singapore Personal Access) users to easily pre-fill forms. It’ll use Singpass to access the personal details we need to confirm your identity. 

We’ll only request the personal details we need, and we’ll need your permission to access them.

 **Who can get verified using Singpass?**

Valid Singpass account holders

 **Who’s eligible for Singpass?**

  * Singapore Citizen and Permanent Resident

  * Employment Pass and Personalised Employment Pass holders

  * EntrePass holders

  * S-Pass holders

  * Dependant Pass holders (of EP, PEP, EntrePass and S-Pass holders)

  * Long Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) holders

  * Long Term Visit Pass holders

  * Selected Work Permit Holders who require Singpass to access government digital services. Visit WPOL Enquiry Service to check your status.




 **Why should I use Singpass?** If you’re eligible, you can use Myinfo to verify your Singpass details in about 1 minute. You also won’t have to upload any extra documents.

 **What if I’m an Employment Pass holder?** You can use Myinfo to verify your identity with Singpass. But you’ll still need to upload a proof of address. 

### What documents do you need if I choose to upload them?

**National identification**

We’ll always need a scan of either your passport or identity card (Pink/Blue NRIC) – we can’t accept driver’s licences.

We need to know how you’re planning to use Wise. You can tell us here.

  * A logo, or clear name of the issuer
