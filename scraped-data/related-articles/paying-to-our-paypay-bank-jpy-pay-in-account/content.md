## Paying to our PayPay Bank JPY pay-in account  
We're making it easier for you to send money in Japan. 

We're adding a PayPay Bank option for account details — this means you'll see a unique new bank account to pay for your transfers or add money to. You'll see this option on the final payment page when setting up a transfer.

 **Why are we changing our bank account details for some customers in Japan from MUFG Bank to PayPay Bank?**

The short answer is to make sending money even faster and easier.

  *  **Faster** : We’ll be able to process most of the payments sent to us instantly, including on weekends and holidays.* This lets us complete your transfers quicker!

  *  **Easier** : Each customer will be provided with their own unique account number at PayPay bank to make the payments. This helps eliminate the risk of delays due to reconciliation when we get your money. 




*It may sometimes take longer for us to confirm payments from some banks. If you send your money to the PayPay Bank account details by 3pm JST on a business day, we should be able to process your payments in a day. If you send us money on public holidays or weekends, it might take longer.
