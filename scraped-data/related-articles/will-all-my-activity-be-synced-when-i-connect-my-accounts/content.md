## Will all my activity be synced when I connect my accounts?  
When you connect your accounts, the Wise activity from the day you connected your Wise and Xero accounts will be synced. 

For example: if you connected your Wise account with Xero on the 1st January, all transactions that appear on your balance activity from the 1st January will be synced. 

If you would like to sync previous transactions, go to ‘ _ **Sync options and status**_ ’ from your _Connection settings_. On this page, you’ll see the option to choose an earlier start date — up to one year.
