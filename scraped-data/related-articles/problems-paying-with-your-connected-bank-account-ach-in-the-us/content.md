### I can’t log in to my bank account

If you have a problem logging in to your bank account, try this first:

  * check that your login details are right — they should be the details you use to log in to your bank account, not your Wise account

  * check whether your bank account allows you to sign in on third parties like Wise — you may need to set up 2-step verification to do this

  * if you need to reset your password or give additional information to log in, you might need to get in touch with your bank




If none of those things work, you still have the option to connect your bank account manually. You can do this on the payment method step or settings by entering your bank account and routing numbers. 

### I paid but the money hasn’t left my account yet

It can take up to 4 business days for money to leave your bank account, depending on your bank. Just make sure you’ve authorized your payment on Wise.

### I don’t see the option to pay with my connected bank account (ACH)

You can only send 50,000 USD per day, or 10,000 USD per day if your address is in Nevada.

You can only send 250,000 USD over a 60 day period on your personal account and up to 400,000 USD on your business account. 

If you try to send more than this, you won’t see the option to pay with your connected bank account (ACH). You can always pay another way, such as with a Wire transfer.

### It says I have insufficient funds, but I have enough in my account

Your bank will check all of the debits you’ve made from your account in the last 4 business days. So, if you’ve made other payments in the last few days, it might show that you have insufficient funds.

You won’t be able to pay with your connected bank account (ACH) until the other payments clear. Try paying another way if you need to send money urgently, or wait a few business days.

### I haven’t got the code to verify my bank login

Try getting the code by email instead. If that doesn’t work, you’ll need to get in touch with your bank to see what’s going wrong. You may need to update your details with them, or try again later.

### I’ve paid from this bank account before, but now it won’t connect

Sometimes, paying from a saved bank account can cause an error. For example, your bank might need to re-verify your bank account connection to keep it secure. We’ll usually re-verify your account when you’re making a payment, but if this fails, you can fix it by adding this bank account like for the first time.
