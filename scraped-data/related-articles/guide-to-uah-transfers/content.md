### Sending to UAH

 **Who can I send UAH to?**

You can send UAH to personal cards that are linked to UAH bank accounts registered in Ukraine. 

You can’t send to junior cards (“Картка Юнiора”) or business cards/accounts. We can't send payments to Sberbank recipients and A-bank (also know as “Accent bank”). 

**What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need the first and last name of the recipient and their full card number. 

Please keep in mind that you'll also need to enter your recipient's address. If you have a saved recipient, you can simply delete and re-add them with their full address. 

When typing in the recipient’s name, please write their last name, first name, then patronymic (optional) in that order. Make sure there aren’t any typos or transliteration errors in the recipient’s name.

If your recipient has more than one first or last name, put the names together with capitalised initials, but without hyphens and spaces. For example: CruzDaCosta AnnaMaria

 **How much can I send?**

For PrivatBank IBAN/card: you can send up to 20 transfers per month, the maximum amount is 29,999 UAH per transfer and 399,999 UAH monthly. For non-PrivatBank IBAN/card recipients: you can send up to 20 transfers per month, the maximum amount is 29,999 UAH per transfer.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once we receive and convert your money, it usually arrives in your recipient’s account on the same working day. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

 **Are there any restrictions on sending to UAH?**

Due to current global sanctions, we can’t send UAH to Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. 

**Is there any other information I need to know?**

You can’t send UAH to email addresses right now.

We’ve had to temporarily restrict incoming UAH payments to Wise cards. We may resume payments again in the future, but for now, we aren’t able to give an exact timeline — we’re working on it. We’re sorry for the inconvenience this may cause, but we hope you understand.
