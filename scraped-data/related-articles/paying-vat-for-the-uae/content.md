## Paying VAT for the UAE  
If you’re a UAE resident, when you send money from United Arab Emirates dirham (AED), we’ll increase your total fees by 5% to cover the Value Added Tax (VAT) we’re required to charge. 

### What is VAT? 

Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the consumption of goods and services — it’s charged when you make a payment. 

VAT is a form of indirect tax. This means businesses are responsible for collecting this tax on behalf of the governing tax authorities. 

### Why is Wise charging me VAT?

As a business processing AED, we’re required to collect the VAT on behalf of the Federal Tax Authority of UAE. We don’t benefit from charging this tax, it goes straight to the tax authority. 

The VAT rate is 5% — so we’re only increasing your fees by exactly this much.
