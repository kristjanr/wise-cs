## Getting verified in Australia  
When you send Australian dollars (AUD) with Wise, we’ll need to verify your identity before you get started. It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations. It usually takes up to 2 working days for us to verify you.

### Verifying your personal account

When you send AUD with your personal Wise account, we’ll ask you to send us a scan in colour of a document that proves your identity. This could be:

  * Passport (including signature and machine-readable zone)

  * Driver’s license (front and back)

  * National ID card (front and back)




It’s important that the document has the same details listed in your Wise account, like name, birthday, and address. 

Once you’ve uploaded your proof of identity, we’ll send you a confirmation email within 2 working days. We might email you to ask for more documents, too.

Once we’ve verified your identity, you can get started sending AUD.

### Verifying your Wise Business account

If you’d like to send AUD for your business you’ll need a Wise Business account. It’ll be attached to your personal account, and we’ll need to verify that first. 

To verify your business, we need to check the identity and address of all directors and shareholders who own 25% or more of the business. We’ll also ask for documents that help us confirm that your business is registered, and how it operates. And depending on your business type, we might need more information, too. 

If you're not the director or a shareholder of the company, we'll ask you to provide an authorisation letter, or a board resolution from the company, confirming that you’re authorised to use and communicate with Wise on behalf of the business. You can download a template of the authorisation letter and have it ready when we ask for it.
