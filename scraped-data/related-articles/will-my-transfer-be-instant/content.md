## Will my transfer be instant?  
While we’re working hard to make all transfers instant, most of them aren’t yet. Please find more info on how long it can take us to process your transfer here.

Once your money is sent out, the status of your transfer will change to "Complete". Delivery time depends on the currency you send and may vary from a few seconds to a few business days.To find out how long it takes in your case, please refer to the list of supported currencies.

If you’re sending from GBP, we offer different types of transfers such as **low cost** **transfers** and **fast and easy transfers**. In this case, the time it takes for your money to arrive also depends on the type of transfer you select.

If you’re sending money to GBP and plan to pay with your balances or a debit/credit card, we'll often be able to deliver your transfer in seconds.
