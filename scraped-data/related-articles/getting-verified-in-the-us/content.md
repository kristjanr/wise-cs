## Getting verified in the US  
When making a transfer from USD, you need to enter your US Social Security number (SSN) so that we can identify you. It’s a completely secure, one-time only verification process that we have to do as part of how we’re regulated in the US. We don’t run a credit check or share your number. 

**Do not send a copy of your social security card.**

Once submitted, your SSN, as with all other private data submitted to us, is securely handled according to data protection regulations.

If your SSN is not accepted, then you will also have an option to verify yourself with an ID. If you’re not a US citizen, we’ll ask for your non-US ID. If you have an ITIN, you’ll be able to enter that and be verified in the same way as an SSN.

You won’t be able to send money until SSN or ID verification has been completed.

### What is an SSN?

An SSN is a unique identification number assigned to every US citizen, permanent resident and temporary working resident.

The number is 9 digits long and can be found on your social security card.

In some cases, we may need additional documentation. We’ll let you know if we do.

### What if I don’t have an SSN?

If you are prompted to enter your SSN, but do not have one, you need to send us a non-US issued ID.

Valid ID can be:

  * passport — photo page only

  * national ID card — front and back

  * driver’s licence — front and back




On the photo or scan of the document we need to see **your photo** , **full name, date of birth, signature,** **expiry date** and **the full machine readable zone** (the MRZ is the 2 lines of letters and numbers at the bottom of the document). The name and date of birth should match the ones on your Wise account.

You need to upload a high-quality image or scan, as it lets us see all the security features on your document. If the image is not high enough quality, we’ll ask you to send it again. 

In the majority of cases, verification takes a maximum of 2 working days.
