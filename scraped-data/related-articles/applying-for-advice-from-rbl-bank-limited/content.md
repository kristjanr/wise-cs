## Applying for advice from RBL Bank Limited  
### Requesting an e-FIRC

RBL can issue an e-FIRC if your recipient's bank account is also with RBL.

To get an e-FIRC from RBL, the recipient can approach their branch or relationship manager and share the transaction details with them. The branch/relationship manager would liaise internally for FIRC issuance.

Otherwise, they can also email RDAServices team (RDAServices@rblbank.com) to get assistance on getting the e-FIRC

If your recipient's bank isn't with RBL, then RBL can't issue an e-FIRC. They'll instead need to reach out to their bank to getting an e-FIRC. 

### Important to note

Export, import, trade, and business-related transfers to India are regulated under strict guidelines from the RBI and FEDAI. Please review these guidelines closely to better understand whether a FIRC can be issued for your transfer.

Remember that FDI transfers are not allowed under RDA. So, please donâ€™t submit FIRC requests about FDI transfers using a different purpose code.
