## Restrictions for Customers based in Myanmar  
We’re not able to serve customers in Myanmar at the moment. 

This means we’re closing all Wise accounts on 30 August 2022 for: 

  * personal customers registered with addresses in Myanmar 

  * business customers where the UBO or Director has a Myanmar address




Here’s what will happen, and what you need to do:

 **1\. Currency accounts for customers in Myanmar will stop working on 16 August 2022**

This means you won't be able to receive any EUR or USD payments using your Wise account, including direct debits. You should move or convert money in this account now.

All payments sent to your EUR or USD account details after August 16th should return to the sender’s bank account. 

**2\. You will only be able to withdraw money from your account from 16 August 2022**

You’ll only be able to withdraw money from your Wise account and no longer be able to add money to your Wise account. This means:

  * Any payments or top-ups to your account will be rejected and sent back to the sender.




 **3\. Move all money out of your Wise account within 60 days**

We'll close Wise accounts of customers in Myanmar on 30 August, 2022. This means you have to move money out of your Wise account (across all currencies), and download any important information.

 **Why is this happening?**

Unfortunately it’s getting increasingly difficult for us to operate in Myanmar so we’ll need to suspend our service.

We know this is a very difficult situation — and we’re so sorry. If you have any questions, our support team is here to help.
