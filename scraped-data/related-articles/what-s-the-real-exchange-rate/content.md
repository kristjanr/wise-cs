## What's the "real" exchange rate?  
We believe the "real" exchange rate is the midpoint between the buy and sell rates on the global currency markets. We get our rate from Reuters, who update the rate in real-time during the trading market opening hours.

You can see the current mid-market rate for your currency route, and its changes over the last 30 days using our rate tracker. You can also sign up for rate alerts there — we’ll send you daily updates on the rate or let you know when it reaches a certain value.
