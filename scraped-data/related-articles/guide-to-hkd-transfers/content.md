### Sending to HKD

 **Who can I send HKD to?**

You can send HKD to any individual or business bank account in Hong Kong that’s denominated in HKD. 

**What information do I need about my recipient?**

You send HKD to someone's local bank account details or FPS ID. 

To send to a local bank account, you'll need their:

  * full name, in Latin characters (a–z) only

  * 9–12 digit local account number

  * 3-digit bank code (also known as the clearing code)

  * Local address




For local bank accounts, there are 2 different formats for account numbers. We need the type that starts with a 3-digit branch code, then a 6–9 digit account number. It should look like this: 123-456789-111.

To send to an FPS ID, you'll need their:

  * full name, in English characters (a–z) only

  * an email, FPS ID (7 or 9 digits), or mobile number linked to a recipient account

  * local address




For FPS ID, if you're sending to a mobile number, please include +852 followed by a dash. It should look like this: +852-12345678

You can’t pay for a transfer by cash or cheque. 

**How much can I send?**

You can send up to 10 million HKD per transfer, depending on how you pay. If you pay by card, for example, the limit is lower — but you’ll only see the option to pay by card if you’re sending less than the limit.

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
