## How much does it cost to convert more than 2 million GBP?  
We already offer discounts for _sending over 100,000 GBP_. When you convert over 2,000,000 GBP (or equivalent in a few selected currencies) between your Wise balances, we apply an even greater discount to the conversion fee.

At the moment, this feature isn't available in Australia*, Brazil, and Malaysia. 

*For Australian residents/businesses: we can manually lift the limits. You just need to reach out via largetransfers@wise.com and ask for assistance. 

#### **How much is the fee?**

The fee is fixed at 0.10% for balance conversions starting from **2,000,000 GBP**. This applies to cumulative volume — for example, if you convert 1 million GBP to EUR (or other selected currency routes) twice, your next conversion will be at 0.10%.

####  **How does it work?**

To get the discount, you need to:

  * Make a balance conversion between any of these currencies: GBP, EUR, CAD, USD. For example, if you convert 2 million GBP to EUR, we’ll apply the discounted fees, but we won’t apply them if you convert 2 million GBP to HUF (or HUF to GBP).

  * Convert money **during market hours and working days** (00:00 — 8:30 PM UTC, from Monday to Friday. Make sure it's also not a bank holiday in the home country of the currency you're converting into).




You can convert up to 5,000,000 GBP (on conversions between GBP, EUR, CAD and USD). If you want to convert more, you’ll need to contact us. 

If you’ve converted 2,000,000 GBP within a month, any subsequent balance conversions between GBP, EUR, CAD or USD during market hours are priced at 0.10%. _Please see_ _ _Terms of Use__ _for your region or visit_ _ _Wise Fees & Pricing__ _for the most up to date pricing and fee information._

The discount applies for both business and personal accounts.
