## How do I repay my transfer?  
### What’s happening?

We completed/refunded a transfer for you, but your direct debit failed so you never actually paid us — we need you to pay for your transfer again. 

Keep in mind, the direct debit option is currently disabled on your Wise account for future transfers, and you won’t be able to make and fund future transfers until your problematic transfer is fixed. 

### My transfer was canceled, why do I need to pay you? 

Although your transfer was canceled, you still initiated the payment, so instead we had to go ahead and issue the refund to you.

After we issued the refund to you, we received a notification your debit wasn’t successful — so we’ll need you to return the refund we gave you. 

### How do I fix my transfer? 

To pay for your transfer again, you’ll need to follow the instructions on the payment page of your transfer. You’ll have one of two options: 

  * Direct debit for a CAD payment, or ACH bank debit for a USD payment




We’re not able to withdraw partial amounts, so you’ll need to make sure you have the full amount available for us when you initiate your payment. 

  * Wire transfer




Your bank may charge you an additional fee to set up the wire to us. 

Keep in mind, you can’t pay for this transfer using a card, Zelle, Interac, cash, or cheque. 

### Will I be charged extra fees?

You’ll only need to pay for the total amount you originally owed for your transfer. 

If you received additional fees from your bank, you’ll need to reach out to them to get this covered — we won’t be reimbursing you for these, as we weren’t the ones to charge them.

After getting in touch with us, you’ll still need to fund your transfer as you had originally authorised and agreed to the payment with us.
