## Getting started with the API  
**1\. Create a free sandbox account (or log in to your real one)**

All you need is an email and password to get your test sandbox account. No verification required. If you already have a Wise account, you can get your personal tokens from your account page.

 **2\. Start playing**

All new sandbox environments are pre-funded with 1,000,000 GBP of test credit. So there’s no need to use your own money. If you don’t want to play, go right to your account page.

 **3\. Create your personal token**

You can create your own personal API token right from your Wise account. Just go to your Settings page and click API tokens. You must have 2-step verification set up.

 **4\. Get ready to go live**

Follow the going live checklist. You get your API tokens from the sandbox or by heading to Settings on your business account page. If your business account is new, make sure you’re also verified and 2-step verification is set up.

 **5\. Start building**

Now that you’re connected, you can build anything you want. Or just automate your payments or processes.

 **6\. That’s it!**

Sit back, relax, and pat yourself on the back. You’re saving yourself a ton of time.
