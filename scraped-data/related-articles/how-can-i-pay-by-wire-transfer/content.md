For USD, you can send up to 1,000,000 USD from licensed states (up to 50,000 USD from Nevada or US territories), and the money will reach us within 1 working day. Your bank will normally charge 15–30 USD to make the wire.

As long as your money reaches us before 4:00 pm (EST) the next business day, the exchange rate you get is guaranteed.

If we have to reject your wire payment, you might receive less back due to fees.
