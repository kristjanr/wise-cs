## How do I invite friends?  
Inviting friends is easy, they just need to click on your unique invite link and join Wise. Your invite link can be found on your invite page.

For your invites to count, they need to 

  * send money, spend with the Wise card or convert money between Wise balances to qualify.

  * make a single transaction in one go (check how much they need to send to qualify on your invite page). 




Keep in mind, same currency transactions don’t count towards this program.

There’s no limit to the number of invites you can send — you can invite as many people as you like.

Once you’re eligible for the reward, we’ll send you an email with instructions on how to get your reward. 

We can send the reward to most currencies Wise supports. You can see the available currencies when you claim your reward.
