## Top questions about the rewards program test  
For select customers, we’re testing a new and exclusive program that helps you save when you send more money with us. 

### **What is the rewards program test?**

You’ll be in for a chance to earn fee-free transfers when you send more money with us in a given month, for as long as we run the test. 

In turn, you help us design the rewards program for other customers — getting first access to it. 

### **Can I invite people to join the test?**

At the moment, we can’t add extra people to the test. Only people that got an invite email about the test can take part.

###  **How do I qualify for the reward?**

We update the reward target you need to reach every month. This gives you more chances to qualify. To earn a fee-free transfer you need to send more volume than your reward threshold volume. You can find your target transfer amount in your Wise Rewards page or in the email we sent you. 

_Please note that you can only access the Wise Rewards page on a desktop browser. That means you can’t access it on the Wise app._

###  **How do I check how much I have transferred?**

You can keep track of how close you are to the rewards target by going to the _Wise Rewards page_. It might take up to 24 hours for the page to update with the amounts you’ve sent — but don’t worry, we’re keeping track.

###  **Which transactions count towards qualifying for the reward?**

Only transfers sent from your personal account to a different currency will count towards qualifying you for the reward. 

The following activities won’t count: 

  * Same currency transfers, for example: USD to USD

  * Card transactions

  * Receiving money into your balances

  * Conversions between balances

  * Transfers that have a fee credit or discount applied

  * Transfers sent from a business account




###  **How do I opt out of the program?**

You can opt-out of the program at any time by using the opt-out link in any of the rewards program emails you have received. 

_When you opt out, we’ll always do our best to remove you from the program straight away. You may still receive notifications about the program for a couple of weeks after your opt-out. That’s because some of our messages are scheduled in advance._

#### If I opt out of the program can I **sign up again?**

Yes, you can _get in touch with our support team_ who can sign you up for the reward program again.

###  **Do I need to send the reward threshold all at once to qualify for the reward?**

No, you can qualify by either sending the full amount in one transfer, or by sending multiple smaller transfers — as long as it’s within the same calendar month. You can keep track of this in the Wise Rewards page.

###  **What’s the reward and how do I receive it?**

The reward is a fee-free transfer. We'll let you know when you qualify for the reward after you’ve sent enough to reach the reward threshold. 

When you hit the threshold, you’ll have to claim your reward through the Wise Rewards page or the transactions page on Wise. You’ll also get an email from us when your reward is ready. 

We'll add the fee-free transfer to your account after you’ve claimed it. We won’t add it automatically. 

Fee-free transfers can only be used on one transfer, and it will be automatically applied to the next transfer you make with us. We’ll show you how much the discount is when you set up your transfer.

Fee-free transfers are only applied to transfers where you’re sending money — they aren’t applied to conversions between balances.

###  **How long after I reach my target is my reward available for?**

You’ve got 6 months to claim your fee-free transfer. We’ll remind you by email if you haven't claimed the reward after 4 months. 

### **Does my free transfer expire?**

The fee-free transfer expires 6 months after you claim it.

###  **Can I choose which transfer the discount / reward is applied to?**

You can’t — the fee-free transfer is automatically applied to your next transfer. 

_Learn more about fee-free transfers_

There may be a 1 hour delay between claiming a reward and it being added to your account.

###  **If I send more than my threshold in a given month will I get extra rewards in that month?**

No, you can only earn 1 fee-free transfer per month.

###  **What happens if I don’t send enough money to reach the reward target?**

Don’t worry, you’ll get the chance to earn a fee-free transfer every month — so you’ll get the opportunity to try again.
