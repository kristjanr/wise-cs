## How does card cashback for businesses work?  
We’re now offering 0.5% cashback on eligible business card transactions to all businesses with Wise Business accounts registered in the UK.

### How does cashback work?

On the first of every month, we’ll reward you with 0.5% cashback on transactions you make with your business card. 

You’ll receive the cashback in your Wise account, and we’ll categorise it as a Reward. We’ll give you your cashback in the currency you spend in. 

Transactions that are cleared by merchants by 00:00 UTC on the 25th of each month will be included in the payout on the 1st of the following month.

To illustrate:

  * You spent 200 GBP with your Wise Business card on 16 Nov

  * The transaction gets cleared by your merchant on 17 Nov

  * You’ll receive 1 GBP cashback on 1 Dec




Here’s another example:

  * You spent 100 GBP with your Wise Business card on 24 Nov

  * The transaction gets cleared by your merchant on 26 Nov

  * You’ll receive your 0.5 GBP cashback on 1 Jan 2023 instead of 1 Dec 2022




Note that the day you spend with your Wise card isn’t necessarily the day your merchant clears the transaction. The clearing date depends on your merchant. 

We’ll send you a push notification on the Wise app and an email once the cashback is paid. You'll see details of your cashback amount in your Wise account once it’s paid.

####  **Who's eligible to get cashback?**

Currently cashback is available to selected Wise business card customers in the UK. We’ll let you know when this is available for customers in other countries.

####  **What transactions can I get cashback on?**

You can get cashback on all transactions with your business card(s), except:

  * Cash or cash-like transactions, like ATM withdrawals, or cashbacks and purchases of gift vouchers

  * Gambling transactions, including bookmakers and casinos

  * Payments to financial institutions (like a credit card provider)

  * Payments connected to commodities, investments, savings or cryptoassets

  * Payments to government bodies or tax authorities




####  **My business owns multiple Wise Business cards. Do I earn cashback on all of them?**

Yes, you can earn cashback on transactions made by all Business cards tagged to your company’s Wise account.

####  **How much cashback can I earn?**

You can earn up to 0.5% of your card’s spending limit on eligible transactions. Spending limits for all team members are linked to the limits for the business account. Find out more about your card spending limits.

The minimum amount of cashback we can pay out is 0.01 GBP. If you make a transaction of less than 2 GBP, cashback won't be paid for this. 

Cashback is a way for us to pass part of our margins back to you. We need to make sure we do so sustainably both for you and for our business, so we might change the cashback rate in the future — but we’ll always let you know first.

####  **What currency would I get the cashback amount in?**

Cashback is paid in the currencies of your eligible transactions. 

To illustrate:

  * If you’ve made 10 transactions (four in USD, three in SGD, three in GBP), you’ll get cashback amounts in the 3 currencies (USD, SGD, GBP)

  * If you’ve made a USD transaction, but didn’t have money in your USD balance so Wise converted GBP to USD for you, the cashback gets paid out in USD — that's the currency your merchant received payment in




####  **What happens if I pay in a currency not supported by Wise?**

We'll default the cashback currency to the currency of your profile country registered with Wise. In this case, if you live in the UK, you’ll get the cashback amount in GBP.

####  **Why am I not getting cashback on certain transactions?**

This could happen for many reasons:

  * Your transaction types may not be eligible for cashback (see list of eligible transactions above)

  * Your transaction isn’t cleared by your merchant yet; you can double-check the status in your account, or with your merchant.

  * Your transaction may have been cleared by your merchant after the cutoff of 00:00 UTC on the 25th of the month — so it’s not calculated for cashback yet. In this case, it’ll be paid out in the following month.

  * Your card or account has been cancelled before the cashback is paid out. We don't pay cashback in this scenario, even if cashback has been accrued before the cancellation date.

  * Your transactions have been refunded or reversed

  * You have moved to another country and changed your profile address. If your profile country is not in the UK anymore, we can't give you cashback, even if it has been accrued before your address change




####  **How can I opt out of cashback?**

You’re automatically enrolled in it by using your Wise Business card. By continuing to use your Wise Business card, you agree to our terms & conditions. If you’d like to opt out of receiving cashback, please get in touch with our team.
