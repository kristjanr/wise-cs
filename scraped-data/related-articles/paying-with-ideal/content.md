## Paying with iDeal  
The iDeal payment method is available for EUR payments for bank accounts in the Netherlands. It’s a simple and convenient way to pay for your transfer on the website and mobile app.

Here are some details about the iDeal payment:

  * The maximum payment is 50,000 EUR per transfer

  * For transfers under 3,000 EUR, it’s instant. For over that amount, it takes 1 working day

  * The refund takes generally 2–3 working days (or a maximum of 10 working days) 




Simply select **iDeal** from the list of payment at the last step of your transfer, then click on **Confirm**. 

You'll be forwarded to iDeal’s own site to enter the required details. Once the payment has been processed you'll be redirected back to Wise.
