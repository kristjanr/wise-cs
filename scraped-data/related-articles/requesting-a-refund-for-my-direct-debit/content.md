## Requesting a refund for my Direct Debit  
Any merchant who has the full combination of your banking details can set up a Direct Debit from your Wise account. We recommend that you only share your account details with parties you know and trust.

Learn how to cancel Direct Debits you don't recognise 

If it's too late to cancel, and your account has already been debited, we can help you dispute the debit and request a refund.

We always recommend researching the merchant’s name as sometimes the merchant might be using a different name when debiting your account. 

If something went wrong with either the goods or services you paid for or the agreement you made with your merchant, we encourage you to get in touch with the merchant directly to get a refund. 

### Requesting a refund for my EUR Direct Debit payment

You can request a refund from us for up to **8 weeks** from the date the payment was made. Once the 8 weeks have passed, a refund request can be made only if the payment wasn’t authorised.

For EUR debits **less** than 8 weeks old, you can request a refund by selecting the transaction on **Home** and selecting “ **Request a refund** ”. This option is only available on the web and becomes available after the debit has settled. This usually happens within a working day.
