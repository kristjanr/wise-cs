## Getting verified in Canada  
We need to verify your identity before you send 1,000 CAD or more when you live in Canada.

That means we’ll ask to verify you if:

  * your transfer is 1,000 CAD or more, or all of your transfers in 24 hours add up to 1,000 CAD or more

  * you’re sending CAD from your bank account or CAD balance

  * you use a Canadian address for your Wise account




We’ll only ask to verify you once.

### What documents will I need?

We’ll ask for 2 different Canadian-issued documents to prove your identity. If you’re a Quebec resident, we’ll need 1 extra document.

We can accept documents that confirm the following information:

  * your name and confirmed financial account (such as a bank statement)

  * your name and residential address (such as an utility bill)

  * your name and date of birth (such as a photo ID)




 **We can only accept the most recent versions of all of these documents. Documents cannot be older than 1 year, except for valid IDs.**

For Quebec residents, we always need a copy of a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a:

  * passport

  * driver’s licence

  * national identity card

### What format do the documents need to be in?

We accept the following formats for these documents:

  * PDF downloaded from your provider’s website or app

  * scanned copy, photo, or screenshot of the full document




We can’t accept photos of screens with digital documents on them.
