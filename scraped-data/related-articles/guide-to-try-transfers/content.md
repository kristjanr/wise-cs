 **Are there any restrictions on sending to TRY?**

Due to Turkish regulations, you can’t send payments to savings accounts. Turkish banks will reject these transfers.

 **Is there any other information I need to know?**

We send out TRY transfers as EFT (electronic fund transfers), so make sure your recipient’s bank account can accept those. The recipient can ask their bank to receive EFT from a Turkish bank before you send the transfer.

### Sending from TRY

 **How can I pay for my transfer from TRY?**

You can pay for your transfers using your TRY balance or by making a local bank transfer.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 3 million TRY per transfer if you pay by bank transfer.

 **Where can I send from?**

You can send TRY from a personal account or business account. For businesses, you must be registered in Türkiye. 

For personal users, the first time you make a transfer from TRY, we’ll ask for your 11-digit Turkish ID Number (T.C. Kimlik No). Because we need to confirm it, your first transfer might take a bit longer than usual. We only have to do this once.

Only businesses that are registered in Türkiye can make bank transfers from Türkiye.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

It usually takes 1 working day for your money to get to us, depending on how you pay for your transfer. Then, we convert it and send it out. Conversion can take up to 2 working days.

 **I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. It takes up to 1 working day for you to get your refund. But we’ll need more information before sending your refund. We’ll send you an email about this.

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
