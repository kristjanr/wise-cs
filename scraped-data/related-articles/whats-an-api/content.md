## What’s an API?  
An API allows different platforms and tools communicate with one another and share important stuff. For example, ever wonder how Google docs can appear on your Slack feed? Well – Google uses the Slack API to keep all your documents in one place. Another example is having the option to create a profile with your Facebook account. It really speeds up getting started with a new food delivery app, right?
