## Getting verified in Brazil  
Due to local regulations, we need some information from you to be able to send money from Brazil.

It typically takes us 2–4 working days to review your information.

### What are the documents I might need to upload? 

Depending on different factors, we might ask for any of these documents at any time. 

**Proof of ID**

We can only accept a Brazilian ID document. Your ID document should be a high quality photo or scan of one of the following:

  * your identity card (RG which must be issued in the past 15 years)

  * your driver’s license (we cannot accept Electronic Driving License)

  * your passport

  * RNM / RNE




If you have plastic protection on your ID document, make sure to remove it before taking the picture for us — it’ll help us see your information better.

 **Proof of address**

You don’t have to live in Brazil to send BRL. 

We can accept a utility, phone, or TV and internet bill as long as they’ve been issued in the past 3 months. Your proof of address needs to show:

  * your name

  * your address

  * date of issue

  * logo/name of issuing entity

  * purpose of the document — we can’t accept an image of the envelope




Make sure we can read everything on the document when you upload it.

 **Proof of income**

We can only accept your proof of income if it’s issued from Brazil. 

To prove your income we’ll need to see all of your Brazilian tax return along with its filing receipt. You can download these from the Receita Federal website.

Based on your income, we’ll determine how much you can send per tax year — 1st April to 31st March. Your income should support the amount of BRL you plan to send for the year. 

### I live abroad, how do I prove my income?

We can only accept proof of income earned during the current tax year in Brazil. You can download your tax return with the filing receipt directly from Brazil’s Internal Revenue Office website. To download the full declaration, you might need to use the IRPF app.

### My family supports me, I don’t receive any other income in Brazil. What can I send?

You can upload your family member, or partners, tax declaration and filing receipt as long as you’re listed as a dependent. They need to have enough income to show they can support you and any other dependents over 18. 

Although you’re a dependent of someone, when you pay for your transfers the money must come from a bank account in your name.

### What if I’m no longer a tax resident in Brazil?

You can’t send money from Brazil if you’re not a tax resident in Brazil — this is because we won’t be able to verify you.
