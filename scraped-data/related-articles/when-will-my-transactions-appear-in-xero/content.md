## When will my transactions appear in Xero?  
We’ll automatically sync your transactions every 4 hours. 

If you need to sync sooner, go to ‘ _ **Sync options and status**_ ’ from your _Connection settings_ and click ‘ _ **Sync now**_ ’. On this page you’ll also see the option to choose an earlier start date — up to one year.
