## Why do you need a document?  
Wise is a financial institution, so we need to know who’s using our service, why they’re using it, and that their money comes from a legitimate place. It helps us combat money laundering, and keep everyone’s money safe.

We need to see a document to prove that your money comes from where you say it does. 

We know this is personal information. So we try to ask for the least we can, to still complete all the checks. We always store your information securely, in line with our privacy policy.
