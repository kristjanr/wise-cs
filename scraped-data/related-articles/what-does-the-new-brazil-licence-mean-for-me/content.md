## What does the new Brazil licence mean for me?  
We’ve become a licenced financial institution in Brazil — so your international transfers are our responsibility now, without the use of intermediaries. 

This means we have more flexibility in the future to bring down prices, offer new products and services, and add new payment methods.

### Is Wise a bank in Brazil now? 

We report directly to the Central Bank of Brazil now. But this doesn’t mean we’ve become a bank. We still need a local bank account to operate and move your money around. For this, we’re using JP Morgan — where we hold our own operating account to transfer money abroad, which is under our responsibility. 

### What you can and can’t do

We’re still making some operational adjustments to our new licence so some of our features aren’t available yet for Brazil. 

**You can:**

  * Add money to your balances in BRL 

  * Hold a BRL balance

  * Get a Wise card in Brazil




 **** **Learn more about sending money to and from BRL** ****

 **You can't:**

  * Send money to or from BRL business accounts




We’ll keep you in the loop on any updates on our instagram, twitter, or facebook.
