### Sending to CAD

 **Who can I send CAD to?**

You can send CAD to any bank account in Canada. 

**What information do I need about my recipient?**

If you’re sending to a bank account, you’ll need their:

  * full name, up to 35 characters, using English characters (a–z) only

  * 3-digit bank institution number

  * 5-digit transit number

  * 7–12 digit account number, without spaces




If your recipient doesn’t know this information, here’s how to find their institution and transit number.

If your recipient has a bank account that supports Interac, you can send them a transfer using their registered email address. When you set up your payment to CAD, just choose the **Interac** tab and enter this. But you won’t get this option if you’re sending from SGD, AUD, NZD, BRL, and INR. 

**How much can I send?**

There's no limit when you send CAD to your recipient's bank using a bank transfer. 

You can send up to 25,000 CAD to an email address using Interac.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once Wise receives and converts your money, it usually takes 1 working day to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

 **Are there any restrictions on sending to CAD?**

You can’t send to brokerages or intermediary banks. You can only send to checking and savings accounts.

You can't send CAD to Canadian USD accounts. Make sure your recipient's bank account is in CAD. 

**Is there any other information I need to know?**

The reference you type in for your recipient won’t show in their account. If you’d like them to see the reference, make sure you enter their email address correctly when you set up the transfer. 

If you’re sending CAD by Interac, your recipient will get two emails: one from Interac with the link to claim the funds, and one from Wise with the PIN. If your recipient doesn’t claim the money in 3 calendar days, the payment gets refunded to you and you need to set up a new transfer.

 **I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. The time it takes for you to get your refund depends on how you paid, 

  * Direct debits take up to 1 working day

  * Card payments take 2–10 working days 

  * Online bill payments take up to 1 working day 

  * Wire transfers take 3+ working days




If you paid using direct debit, we’ll return the money to you — please wait for our refund.

If you paid by online bill payment or wire transfer, we might need more information before sending your refund. We’ll send you an email if we do.

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
