## Getting verified in Japan  
We need to verify your identity before you can send Japanese Yen (JPY) for the first time. This helps us keep your money safe and comply with regulations. 

Once you’re verified to send money from Japan, you can’t pay for transfers from other currencies using bank transfer or debit/credit card. Instead, you can send from your balances. You can send up to 1 million JPY or equivalent per transfer.

If you don't live in Japan, but want to send from JPY, you'll need to submit an ID and proof of address. 

If you live in Japan, the process to get verified can be confusing, so we’ve listed out step-by-step instructions and common mistakes. 

### Step-by-step instructions

It’s easiest to get verified on the app, but you can also use our website. Here are the steps to get verified:

 **Step 1: Choose which ID you’d like to upload. The ID has to have your current Japanese address recorded on it.**

We can accept any of these Japanese IDs:

  * My Number cards – we can’t accept returned My Number cards, or My Number notifications slips (a green colored paper)

  * Japanese driver's licenses

  * Japanese passports issued before February 2020 

  * Residence cards




 **Step 2: Write down the 4-digit code we give you**

The code we show you is made only for you, and expires after 30 minutes. So quickly write it down on a small piece of paper. 

You’ll need the code later for some pictures — write it down largely and clearly. 

**Step 3: Take three pictures of your ID**

  1. Take a picture of the front of your ID, with the code you’ve written down directly below it. 

  2. Tilt the ID so we can see the thickness of the document. Please make sure you can still see the details on the ID while tilting it. You don’t need the code for this one. 

  3. Take a picture of the back of your ID. You don’t need the code for this one (This is not applicable for passport submissions).




Keep a hold of your code for the next step. 

**Step 4: Take a picture of yourself holding the code**

Now we need to see a picture of you holding the code, which you wrote down earlier, next to your face. 

**Step 5: Show us your My Number**

(If you chose to use a My Number card in step 1, you can skip this step.) 

We accept any of these documents that have your My Number (個人番号) and current address on them:

  * Notification card (通知カード)

  * My Number card

  * Juminhyo (住民票), aka residence record. The document has to be issued within the last 6 months and with any other family member's details covered. You can get this on the spot at your local city hall




 **You’re all done!**

It usually takes our team a couple of working days to review your pictures. In the meantime, you can finish and pay for your transfer — it’ll help speed up your verification. 

### **Common mistakes when getting verified**

 **The address on your Wise account and ID has to be your current one.**

  * _Change your address_ to your current one before getting verified.




 **Your 4–digit code wasn’t in your pictures**

  * The first picture you take must have your 4–digit code below your front-facing ID

  * The last picture you take is a selfie. We need to see your 4–digit code next to your face in this picture




 **Your pictures were blurry**

  * If you can’t read the ID in your picture — our team can’t either




 **Your tilted picture wasn’t taken correctly**

  * We need to see the thickness of your ID and some details of your front-facing ID
