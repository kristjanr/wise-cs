## Fees for using Wise Business  
**How much does it cost to open a Wise Business account?**

It’s easy to open a Wise Business account.

When you get account details for the first time on your business account, you’ll need to pay a small one-time setup fee and then get verified.

If you're in the EEA or the UK, you'll need to pay a 45 GBP (50 EUR) fee when signing up.

For other regions, it's free to sign up, and the fee to open account details depends on where your business is registered. You can **check our pricing page** what fee we'll charge you — it can be 16–42 GBP (or equivalent in another currency). Some countries cost us more to verify you, so we might charge you a higher fee. You can only pay the fee using your debit/credit card or from your balance. If you want to pay from a currency account, you would first need to add money to your account.

After paying the fee, we’ll get started on verifying your business. Once verified, you’ll get your account details. If we can’t verify your business, we’ll refund the fee back to you. 

You only have to do these 2 steps for the first set of account details you get. After that, you can freely get account details for any of the other currencies that have them. 

All of your account details will also show in your Account tab in the Account Services section.

 **How much does it cost to convert money in the Wise Business account?**

There’s a small fee to convert between currencies — either in your account, or if you spend on your Wise Business card in a currency you don’t have in your account.

When you convert money in your account, it’s always with the real exchange rate. And we always show you our fees upfront, so there are no surprises.
