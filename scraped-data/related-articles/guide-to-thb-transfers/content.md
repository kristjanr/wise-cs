####  **How to get your THB transfer marked as International Transfer by the recipient bank?**

If your recipient Bank is Kasikorn Bank or Bangkok Bank:

  1. Set transfer amount and currency to THB

  2. Add recipient details

  3. Choose **Kasikorn Bank** or **Bangkok Bank Public Company** as the recipient bank

  4. Enter account number

  5. On Transfer Purpose: select **Funds for long term stay in Thailand** or **Purchase of Property**

  6. Review transfer details and **Confirm**

  7. Select pay-in method, and pay for your transfer

  8. You’re all set! 




Your transfer should be marked as **International Transfer** in your recipient bank’s app, website, or passbook.*

If you followed these steps but your transfer was not marked as **International Transfer,** please contact our respective bank partners to get an FET form. See instructions below for Bangkok Bank, Kasikorn bank, and Deemoney. 

_*For Kasikorn Bank, ‘Trade Finance Deposit' marking is equivalent to ‘International Funds Transfer’._

####  **What if my recipient uses a different bank?**

You can ask for a FET form. See more information below.

####  **What’s a Foreign Exchange Transaction (FET) form?**

A FET form is a document that confirms money sent into Thailand came from abroad. When a bank receives a transfer of 50,000 USD or more, they have to send a FET form to the Bank of Thailand to report the money.

You’ll need a FET form if you’re a foreigner buying property in Thailand, or if you’re applying for a Thai visa.

####  **Why can’t Wise give me a FET form?**

We aren't authorised by the Bank of Thailand to issue FET forms. It’s because of how we work: when you send money with us, we use our Thai banking partners to send out your money locally. It doesn’t cross any borders, so it doesn’t show up as a foreign transaction.

####  **How can I get a FET form?**

The recipient needs to ask for a FET form from the partner bank that we paid your money out from. You can check which bank this is on your transfer receipt. To find it:

  1. Go to the transfer in the **Activity** section of your Wise account

  2. Click **View transfer details**

  3. Click **Download PDF receipt**

  4. Go to the second page to find banking partner details




####  **Transfers sent via Bangkok Bank**

 **How to contact:**

  *  **For a customer who maintains an account with Bangkok Bank:** contact Bangkok Bank branch where you maintain the account.

  *  **For a customer who maintains an account with another local bank in Thailand and if your funds transfer was sent through Bangkok Bank as an intermediary bank:**

  * Contact Bangkok Bank Head Office branch via their call centre between during banking hours

  * If you're located in a provincial area, you can contact your local Bangkok Bank branch to help you coordinate with the Bangkok Bank Head Office branch




 **Documents needed by Bangkok Bank:**

If the transfer was sent out by Kasikorn Bank, the recipient needs to go to their nearest Kasikorn Bank International Trade centre. They’ll need to bring:

  * their Bank Savings Passbook or statement showing the transaction

  * their passport

  * their visa (if applicable)

####  **Transfers sent via Tranglo**

Tranglo supports payouts to Siam Commercial Bank for THB 50,000 and above. If the transfer was sent out by Tranglo, the recipient needs to contact Siam Commercial Bank via their call center and provide the following information:

  * Recipient details

  * Date & time of the transaction that they are requiring for a CA/FET




Recipients will be verified by Siam Commercial Bank during the call and the form will be received to their verified email tied to their Siam Commercial Bank account.

It may take up to three working days for the form to be sent by Siam Commercial Bank.

There are no charges from Tranglo nor SCB at the moment for this requirement.

####  **Transfers sent via Deemoney**

If the transfer was sent out by Deemoney, the recipient needs to send an email to support@dee.money with the following details: 

  * clearly state that this is a request for an FET form for an overseas incoming transaction from Wise

  * banking partner reference (can be taken from your transfer receipt) 

  * sender name

  * recipient name




Deemoney will issue the FET letter free of charge.

#### SWIFT transfers

Sometimes, we might send your transfer through a different banking partner who can’t provide a FET. This might be because of a technical issue, or some other unforeseen event.

If you know you definitely need a FET, it’s best that you send a SWIFT transfer with your bank this time. SWIFT is a more expensive method, because it’s not a local transfer. But it does mean you’ll be able to prove that the money came from abroad.
