## Getting verified in Malaysia  
We need to verify your identity before you make a transfer in Malaysian Ringgit (MYR). It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations. 

When you set up your first transfer from MYR, we’ll ask for your nationality and occupation — we’ll give you a list of occupations to select from. Then you’ll need to upload an ID document and take a selfie with or without your ID. Depending on your nationality, we might also ask for your visa document.

### What can I upload for my photo ID? 

**If you’re a Malaysia national,** we can accept these ID documents:

  * Passport

  * MyKad




 **If you’re not a Malaysia national,** we can only accept your passport.

### I’m not from Malaysia, how can I get verified? 

We might ask you to upload your visa document. 

We can accept these visa documents:

  * Employment pass categories 1–3

  * Dependent pass 

  * Residence pass

  * Student pass 

  * Social visit pass

  * i-KAD

  * Talent iKAD

  * VisitPass: Temporary Employment




We don’t accept E-visas, Letters of Visa Approval or single entry visas.

### Why do I need to take a selfie to get verified? 

In order for us to verify you, we’ll need either a photo of yourself holding your ID next to your face, or just a selfie — you can’t upload a picture, you have to take it in the moment. You can only do this if your device has a camera.

When taking your photo, make sure you’re in a well-lit environment and we can clearly see you in the photo. 

**What to do if you get the error message: “Sorry no usable camera could be found”**

  * Attempt verification on a different browser, either desktop or mobile — we work best with Google Chrome

  * Check if you’ve enabled the camera 

  * Try using incognito mode

  * Enable cookies

  * Download the Wise app on your Android device and reattempt transfer




### I wasn’t able to get verified, what do I do? 

If you weren’t able to get verified, you need to create a mock transfer to reattempt your verification. When you’ve completed the verification, you can cancel this transfer — you don’t have to pay for it.
