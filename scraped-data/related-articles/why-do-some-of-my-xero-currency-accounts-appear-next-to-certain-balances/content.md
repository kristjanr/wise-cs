## Why do some of my Xero currency accounts appear next to certain balances?  
You’ll see some of your Xero currency accounts already appear once your accounts are connected. These are accounts we think you may want your Wise balances synced to. 

If any don’t look right, click Edit to choose another account or remove it. You also can create a new currency account in Xero without leaving Wise. You can only sync a Wise balance to a Xero account of the same currency.
