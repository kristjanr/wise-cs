### Sending to RUB

 **Who can I send RUB to?**

You can send RUB to bank accounts or cards in Russia.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

In Russia, you can send to either a bank account or card. 

If you send to a card, we'll need:

  * recipient’s full name in Latin letters (a–z)

  * recipient’s address, including the region they live in within Russia

  * recipient’s card number, which should start with a 4, 5, or 6, and be 13, 16, 18, or 19 digits long




If you send to a bank account, we need:

  * recipient’s full name in Cyrillic letters, including patronymic name (Oтчество). This must match the name on the recipient’s bank account

  * recipient’s address, including the region they live in within Russia

  * recipient’s bank account number, which should be 20 digits long (for example, 40817810XXXXXXXXXXXX)

  * recipient’s BIK, a 9-digit Russian bank identification code




 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 100,000 RUB to card recipients, but up to 50 million RUB to recipient bank accounts.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once we receive and convert your money, it usually takes 0–2 working days to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. If you’re sending to their card, it usually arrives on the same working day. 

Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

 **Are there any restrictions on sending to RUB?**

Due to how we’re regulated, we can only send RUB to private individuals in Russia. We can't send to businesses or government authorities.

Due to current EU sanctions, we cannot send RUB to Crimea or Sevastopol.

The impact of ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region mean it’s difficult to operate in Russia. We know this is a difficult situation, and we’re sorry.

 **Is there any other information I need to know?**

We can’t send USD or EUR to accounts in Russia.
