## How do I close my Wise Business account?  
When you sign up for a Wise Business account, you may or may not have a personal account attached to it. You can close just the business account, or both the personal and business accounts.

In either scenario, there are a few things you can do before closing your account(s):

  * Withdraw all money left on the balances

  * Download your transfer receipts and balance statements

  * Disconnect from all accounting platforms (e.g. Xero)

  * Switch all your money to cash and wait until fees are taken

  * Complete or cancel all pending transactions 




After completing the steps above

  1. Go to your settings on the website (not available in the app)

  2. Click **Close your account** and follow the prompts to confirm the account closure 




Once your account is closed, you won't have access to any of the activity or account statements on it anymore.

 **To withdraw money:**

  1. Go to **Home**

  2. Click on any balance with money in it

  3. Click **Send**

  4. Choose the bank account you want to send the money to

  5. When asked how much youâ€™d like to send, choose **Send it all**

  6. Click **Confirm**
