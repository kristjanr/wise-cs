## Getting verified in Hong Kong  
We need to verify your identity when you first send HKD from an account in Hong Kong or your Wise HKD balance.

You'll also need to be verified if you're opening a business account.

We’ll ask for a document to prove your identity, as well as a selfie. The document you send us will need to show your nationality. We accept driving licences, national ID cards or passports (photo page only). We need to be able to see the whole document, and read all the details on it. That includes any visible security features — like the code at the bottom of a passport photo page.

Your first HKD transfer should be made via bank transfer. You can use any payment method for transfers after that.
