## How can I find my US account and routing number?  
Youâ€™ll find your account and routing number at the bottom of any check in your checkbook. The first 9 digits are your routing number, and the rest is your account number.

You can also find them if you log into your internet bank. Your account number should be next to your accounts, and your 9 digit routing number should be amongst your more detailed information.
