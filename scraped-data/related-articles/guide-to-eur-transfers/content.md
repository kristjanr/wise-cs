### Sending to EUR

 **Who can I send EUR to?**

You can send EUR to any SEPA country. You can also send EUR to countries outside of the SEPA zone, but this might cost more. 

**What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need to know their full name and bank account number. In Europe, this is a code called an IBAN, and is between 14 and 34 digits long. Use our IBAN checker to make sure the IBAN you have is in the right format.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 6 million EUR per transfer.

Please keep in mind, if you want to send more than 1.2 million EUR, you’d need to transfer it from your Wise account. This means:

  1. You’ll need to open an account for the currency you want to convert **from** , and the currency to convert **to** (EUR). 

  2. You’ll need to add money to your source currency account. 

  3. You can instantly convert the money once it’s in your Wise account to EUR. 




Once the conversion is done, you can simply withdraw your money from your Wise account.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once Wise receives and converts your money, it usually takes 1–2 working days to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

If you paid using either Trustly, SOFORT, or iDEAL, we’ll have to wait to receive your money before we can refund it back to you.

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
