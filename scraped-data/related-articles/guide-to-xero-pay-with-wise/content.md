## Guide to Xero Pay with Wise  
**Xero Pay with Wise** is a service with Xero that lets small businesses in the UK pay and manage bills. It’s a seamless process to pay multiple bills and reconcile transactions easily, regardless of your bank.

Right now, you can only make GBP to GBP payments up to 1 million GBP per transaction with Xero Pay. But keep in mind, your bank may have its own limits on how much you can send at once.

When using Xero Pay with Wise — Wise (not Xero) processes your payments.

You’ll need both a Xero and a Wise account to use Xero Pay with Wise. If you’re new to Wise, we’ll need to verify you and your business first.

It can take 1–2 working days for us to verify you. If we need any more information from you, we’ll send you an email. And we’ll let you know as soon as we’ve finished verifying you.

### How do I make a batch payment?

  1. Enter your bills on Xero, and choose the ones you’d like to pay

  2. Choose Pay with Wise and complete the payment details

  3. Transfer from your bank account to Wise, and enter the correct batch number in the reference field. Make sure you transfer the exact amount




You can choose only one form of payment for the batch — either a bank transfer or pay from your balance.

To pay by bank transfer, you'll need to send us the money from your external Wise account. Make sure to add the batch number as a reference so we can link your money to the right batch. Then just go to your Wise batch transfer, and **mark as paid**.

To pay from your balance, just select balance payment at the payment step. You won't be able to choose this form of payment after you clicked **mark as paid**.

### How long does it take?

It usually takes seconds to 2 hours for us to complete your transfer. Sometimes, it can take a little longer — up to 1 working day. This is because we might need to carry out extra checks on your money to keep it safe.

You can always track the status in your Xero account.

If your Xero batch is not funded within 10 working days, it will be automatically cancelled.
