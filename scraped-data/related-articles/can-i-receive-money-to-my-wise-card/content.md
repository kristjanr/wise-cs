## Can I receive money to my Wise card?  
All cards (except for US and Japan issued cards) can receive money by using the 16-digit card number.

### What currencies can I receive? 

You can receive any of the 50+ currencies that you can hold in your Wise account. But if you receive a non-supported currency, we'll simply credit it in the default currency of your card. 

### How long will it take for the money to arrive? 

The money should arrive in just a few seconds, but depending on the sender's bank it might take longer.

###  Refunds

A refund will arrive in the currency your sender sends it. **Quick tip:** Our support team will never ask for your card number. Never share your card number with an unsolicited caller, including your CVV, PIN, OTP (one time password), or Internet Banking User ID & Password.
