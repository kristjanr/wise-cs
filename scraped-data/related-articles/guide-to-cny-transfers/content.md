###  **Why was my transfer delayed or cancelled?**

Your transfer may be delayed or cancelled if your recipients didn't complete verification or card binding in time, prompted by Alipay (72 hours) and WeChat (48 hours). 

Your transfer may also be delayed when we need more information about your transfer purpose, requested by the local authorities.

If your transfer is cancelled, your money will automatically go back to you within 3 working days.
