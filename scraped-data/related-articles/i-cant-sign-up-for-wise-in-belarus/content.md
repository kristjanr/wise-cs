## I can’t sign up for Wise in Belarus  
We’re not able to serve customers in Belarus at the moment. This means that you won’t be able to open a Wise account if your address is in Belarus or you reside there. 

**Why is this happening?**

The impact of ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region mean it’s difficult to operate in Belarus. So, we need to suspend new accounts for customers in Belarus. We know this is a difficult situation, and we’re sorry.
