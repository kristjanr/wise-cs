## How do I receive money with Interac Autodeposit  
To receive money with Interac, you'll first need to open a CAD Balance and get account details. Then just follow these steps:

  1. Click on your **CAD Balance** on the web — it's not available on mobile at the moment.

  2. Click **Receive > Receive with Interac**.

  3. Select **Register email with Interac**.

  4. You’ll receive an email from Interac to complete your registration. You’ll then receive a confirmation email that your Interac account is registered with People’s Trust. This is our banking partner for CAD balances.




##  **How does it work?**

Interac is an interbank network for receiving e-transfers (payments) without sharing your bank details.

When your payers send money to your registered Interac email address, you'll receive it into your Wise Balance. 

  * There are no fees to receive Interac payments

  * You can receive payments 24/7 — usually they arrive within 20 minutes

  * You can receive 25,000 CAD per day. However, the sender’s bank may have limits on how much they can send.

  * It's not available for businesses at the moment, but we're working on it. 




**Can I set this up without Autodeposit?**

No, at this time you can only set this up using Autodeposit.

 **How do I claim money on Interac?**

Autodeposits are sent directly to your Wise Account, so there’s no need to claim them.

 **I have Autodeposit set up with another bank. What happens if I enable this through Wise?**

It'll remove Autodeposit at your other bank and set it up with Wise.
