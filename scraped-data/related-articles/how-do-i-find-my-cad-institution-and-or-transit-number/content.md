## How do I find my CAD institution and/or transit number?  
When you send money to and from a Canadian bank account, you will need to have three account details at hand: Financial Institution number (3 digits), Branch Transit Number (5 digits), and Account Number (7-12 digits).

Here are a couple options to help you find this information.

### Option 1: Look at your checkbook

### Option 2: Log into your internet banking

### Option 3: Find the Institution number in the list below

Please note: These numbers are accurate to the best of our knowledge, but if you are unsure it is always best to check with the recipient’s bank. These numbers should only be used to confirm details you already have.

### Option 4: Routing Number

Routing number format: **0YYYXXXXX**

where: **YYY - institution number** **XXXXX - transit number**

For example, if Bank’s routing number is 026011242, the institution number is 260, and the transit number is 11242.

You can check the validity of the Institution and Transit number combination on Canada Banks Information website.
