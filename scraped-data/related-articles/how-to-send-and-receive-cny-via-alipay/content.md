## Sending money

####  How can I send Chinese Yuan (CNY) to an Alipay user with Wise?

  1. Log into your Wise personal account and set up a transfer to CNY.

  2. Choose or add a recipient.

  3. Choose Alipay under **Bank details** , 

  4. Tell us who you’re sending to by entering your recipient's name and Alipay ID (email or phone number registered with Alipay).

  5. Give some information about why you’re sending the money.

  6. Check that all details are correct before paying for your transfer.




And that's it!

Please note that only Alipay users who are Chinese citizens registered with a Chinese Mainland Resident Identity Card can receive an international payment with Wise.

### What currencies can I send from?

You can send money from a personal Wise account from these 25 currencies: AUD, BGN, BRL, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, HUF, IDR, INR, JPY, MYR, NOK, NZD, PLN, RON, SEK, SGD, TRY and USD. 

We don't support Business accounts. 

Alipay also doesn't support customers sending from China, Crimea Region, Cuba, Donetsk Region, Iran, Luhansk Region, Nigeria, North Korea, and Syria.

### Who can I send CNY to on Alipay?

Anyone can get money if they're a Chinese citizen, and have an Alipay app. Your money will be sent to your recipient’s Alipay wallet, or the bank account linked to their Alipay ID. The money is paid out in seconds, depending on the receiving method. It should arrive within 72 hours after it's sent. 

You can only send to individual recipients, and not businesses.

### How much can I send?

The limit for each transfer is 50,000 CNY, with an annual limit of 500,000 CNY per recipient. Each recipient also has a monthly limit of 5 transactions per month. 

The 500,000 CNY annual limit and 5 transactions per month include payments the recipient gets on their Alipay account from all services — not only Wise.

## Receiving money

### How does my recipient receive the money via Alipay?

Alipay users can get money with their Alipay e-wallet or bank account linked to their Alipay account. 

When your recipient gets an international transfer for the first time on Alipay, they'll get an SMS from Alipay with a unique URL.

They should click on it to open the Alipay app. 

  1. Your recipient can share their details from the Alipay App with you.

  2. On the app, complete real name authentication 

  3. Sign the service agreement 

  4. Select the receiving method — either Alipay wallet or bank card.

The recipient might need to give more information, like a photocopy of their ID card, or address for verification.




### How can my recipient check the transfer status? 

Once the transfer is sent, the recipient gets an SMS and a push notification with all transfer details.

For more information, view this step-by-step guide in _English_ and _Mandarin_.

### I gave the wrong recipient name or recipient Alipay ID. What should I do?

On the recipient creation page, Wise checks the recipient name and their connected Alipay ID. We display an error message on the screen if you enter the wrong name or ID.

### What should I choose for transfer reason?

We have to comply with Chinese regulations, and the transfer reason for payments to Alipay users can only fall under these 4 categories:

  *  **Money to Family** : Alipay might ask the recipient to sign and provide a kinship commitment letter that proves the relationship between you and your recipient.

  *  **Salary payment** : Alipay might ask the recipient to show their payroll.

  *  **Goods** : Alipay might ask the recipient to show an invoice or contract

  *  **Services** : Alipay might ask the recipient to show an invoice or contract




If your transfer reason is for Goods or Services, you'll be prompted to give more information by choosing a sub-transfer reason. 

Alipay may also reach out to some recipients to ask for additional documents to support the transfer reason.

### Why was my transfer cancelled?

Your transfer can be cancelled for different reasons. Sometimes, there are extra security checks on your account. There are also card binding settings on Alipay, which need to be finished within 72 hours of getting the notification. Your transfer could also be cancelled if your recipient has reached their receiving limit. 

### My recipient didn't get the transfer notification or SMS link.

Ask your recipient to contact the Alipay customer service via the App. 

### My recipient didn't get the money. What can I do?

Firstly, please check if your recipient finished the account compliance check or card binding settings on the Alipay app in the link sent by SMS. If they have, contact the Alipay customer support in the app.

### My transfer failed. How can I find out why?

Contact Alipay customer support on the Alipay’s app to get help. 

### Why can I only get 5 payments per month?

To comply with Chinese regulations, the limit to receive 5 payments per month is in line with the payment reasons “Money to Family”, “Salary payment”, “Goods” and “Services”.

### Can I cancel a transfer that I already sent?

You can't cancel a transfer that has been sent. If the recipient doesn't get the money in 72 hours, it'll be cancelled automatically, and the money will be refunded to you.
