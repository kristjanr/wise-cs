## Restrictions for customers based in Türkiye  
Due to new local regulations, we need to make some changes in how you can use Wise **if you live in Türkiye**. You can find all information about these changes in this article. We'll also email you soon if your Wise account is affected. 

#### **You can continue to use Wise to:**

  * send international transfers from your Turkish bank account.

  * withdraw any money you have on your Wise balances. We’ll continue to safeguard the money you hold with us. 




#### **From 31 May 2023, you won’t be able to:**

  * top up your balances from TRY. When you try to add money, you won’t see TRY as an available currency.

  * get new account details in any currency. If you didn’t have any account details before 31 May 2023, you won’t be able to request them in the future. 




#### **From 30 August 2023, you won’t be able to:**

  * open new balances or jars to hold money in different currencies.

  * convert between your balances. 

  * add money to your existing balances.

  * receive money into you Wise account. Any Wise account details you have will stop working, and money sent to these will be returned to the sender. Make sure to let your senders know that they can no longer send money to your Wise account

  * pay bills using Direct Debits. All existing Direct Debits will be cancelled.

  * send money to others from your Wise balances — you’ll only be able to send money to yourself from a balance 




#### **Can I still send money abroad after 30 August 2023?**

Yes, you can continue to send international transfers with Wise from your Turkish bank account. 

Others can also continue to use Wise to send money to your Turkish bank account. 

#### **What if I no longer live in Türkiye?**

If you moved, but your address on Wise is still in Türkiye, please update your address. We may ask you to send us a proof of address to verify you. If your new address is in an eligible country, you can continue to use your balances and account details. 

#### **Will you offer these features again in the future?**

We’re always looking to offer our services to as many people as possible. We don’t have a timeline at the moment, but we’ll let you know once the account details are available in Türkiye again.
