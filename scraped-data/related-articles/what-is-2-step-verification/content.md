## What is 2-step verification?  
2-step verification is another layer of security on your account, on top of your password. 

We use 2-step verification when we need to confirm it's really you.

###### The 2 steps are:

  1. Enter your password

  2. Confirm that it’s you through the Wise app on a trusted device, or enter a code you receive by text message, phone call or from your authenticator app 




The second step may not come directly after the first. For example, we might only ask for a verification code when sending money, as you’ve already entered your password when you logged in. 

### **Benefits of 2-step verification**

Even if someone finds your password, 2-step verification helps stop them getting into your account.

You’ll also be able to see that someone else has tried to log in, because you’ll get a code or notification.

###  **2-step verification methods**

There are 3 ways to complete 2-step verification:

  * receive a code by text message or phone call

  * receive a notification in the Wise app on a trusted device

  * enter a code from a separate authenticator app




If you choose the first one, we’ll send you a code by text message or phone call when we need to confirm it’s really you. You’ll need to enter the code before you can continue.

If you choose to use the app, we’ll send a notification to the Wise app on your trusted device. You’ll need to confirm on your device to continue.

If you use an authenticator app, you’ll need to pair it with your Wise account first. Then we’ll ask for the code from your authenticator app when we need to confirm it’s really you.

It’s best to use the app or an authenticator app for 2-step verification. They only need an internet connection, so they’ll work even if you’re abroad or changed your SIM.
