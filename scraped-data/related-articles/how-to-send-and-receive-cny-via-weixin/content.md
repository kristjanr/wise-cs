##  **Sending money**

###  **How can I send Chinese Yuan (CNY) to a Weixin user with Wise?**

  1. Log into your Wise personal account, and set up a transfer to CNY. 

  2. Choose Weixin, then tell us who you’re sending to by entering your recipient's name and Weixin ID (phone number registered with Weixin).

  3. Give us some information about why you’re sending the money.

###  **Who can I send to?**

Anyone can get money if they’re a Chinese citizen with a Chinese National ID, are aged 18–65, and have a bank card linked to their Weixin account, or link a bank account to their account within 48 hours of the transfer being started. You can send CNY to individual recipients, but not businesses. 

### **How much can I send?**

Each transaction is capped at 50,000 CNY, with an annual limit of 500,000 CNY per recipient. Each recipient is also subject to a monthly limit of 5 transactions per month. 

The 500,000 CNY annual limit per recipient and 5 transactions per month include those received by the recipient’s Weixin account from services other than Wise.

##  **Receiving money**

There are 2 ways for your recipient to get money from you. They can either receive it on their Weixin e-wallet, or to a bank card linked to their Weixin account. Your recipient just needs to follow the instructions below once they get the notification from Weixin. 

### When they get an international transfer on Weixin for the first time

  1. Your recipient should share their details with you. To find their name and Weixin ID on the Weixin app, they can search **微汇款** (Micro Remittance), and select **全球收款** (Global Transfer). Now they can create a **Receipt Card** they can share with you. 

  2. After you set up the payment, your recipient will get an SMS from Weixin — it'll include a unique URL for them to receive the transfer. Wise will also send you an email and an in-app push notification with the same URL to share with your recipient. 

  3. Click on the link to get started, choose **Collect Transfer** in the Weixin app.

  4. From there, they can simply follow the instructions to authorise their phone number, and choose the receiving method — e-wallet or bank card. Both methods still need users to bind a bank card to their Weixin account. 

  5. They should verify their personal information.* 

  6. Your recipient must digitally sign a kinship commitment letter to confirm their relationship with you if they're receiving money with the purpose **Sending money home to family**.

  7. The money goes to the chosen bank card almost immediately.




*Local regulations from September 2022 state that all users need to give additional personal information, and sign an updated service agreement before receiving a transfer. This includes: recipient residing area, ID effective date, ID expiry date, residing address in China and occupation. 

Note that the unique link expires in **48 hours**. If your recipient doesn't finish the steps in that time, your transfer will be cancelled.

###  **I provided the wrong recipient name, Weixin ID, or phone number. What should I do?**

If you provided the wrong recipient name and phone number, the transfer will fail, and the recipient won't be able to collect the money from this transfer. The money will automatically be refunded to you 48 hours after the payment was made.

Read the **Receiving Money** section to learn how to get this information on Weixin and share with your sender.

###  **Is there an age restriction to send money to a Weixin user?**

You can send money on Weixin if you're aged between 18-65 years old.

###  **What should I choose for "remittance purpose"?**

To comply with Chinese regulations, the remittance purpose supported for transfers to Weixin users can be either Salary Payment or Family.

  * If you declare the money is sent to "Family" _,_ the bank will need the recipient to sign a kinship commitment letter.

  * If you declare the money is sent as "Salary Payment" _,_ the recipient will need to declare their payroll.




Weixin may also reach out to some recipients to ask for more documents to support the transfer reason.

###  **Why was my transfer cancelled?**

Your transfer can be cancelled for many reasons.

It will be cancelled and refunded if you don't complete your account binding settings, and sign the Kinship Commitment Letter within 48 hours after getting the notification. This is applicable for receiving a Family Support transfer from a sender for the first time in Weixin. 

Your transfer could also be cancelled if you've reached your receiving limit.

In this case, reach out to the sender to resend the payment.

###  **My recipient didn't get the transfer notification or SMS link.**

Please contact Weixin Customer Support to get help.

###  **My recipient didn't get the money. What can I do?**

Check if you finished the account binding settings on Weixin via the text message link, and signed the Kinship Commitment Letter if you were prompted. If you've done so and need more help, just contact Weixin Customer Support.

###  **My transfer failed. How can I find out why?**

You can find this on the Weixin app. Just contact Weixin Customer Support with screenshots of your failed transfer and payment order with the order number starting with "R".

###  **Why can I only get 5 transfers per month?**

This is to comply with Chinese regulations. The receiving limit of 5 remittance transactions per month is in line with the remittance purpose "Family Support" and "Salary".

###  **Can I cancel a transfer that I've already sent?**

You can't cancel a transfer that has been sent. If the recipient didn't complete the account binding settings, or sign the Kinship Commitment Letter within 48 hours — the transfer is cancelled automatically. The money will be refunded to you.
