**How can I pay for my transfer from PHP?**

You can pay for your transfer from PHP by sending money to our registered bank account in the Philippines.

You have to send money from your own bank account registered in your own name. We will ask you to provide proof of transfer for **each transaction** for verification purposes. This is because we have to comply with various regulations globally.

Your **proof of transfer** must include:

  * Bank logo & name

  * Your name

  * Your account number

  * Amount sent to us

  * Date of transfer




You can usually obtain your proof of transfer through your mobile banking app or by taking a screenshot of your bank book/statement. Feel free to cross out any confidential transactions that are not relevant to your transfer.

 **How much can I send?**

You can send up to 1,000 USD (or the equivalent in your chosen currency) per transfer.

 **How much will I be charged for my transfers?**

The fees you pay will vary depending on the currency route. The more money you send, the more your transfer costs. That’s because the Wise fee is a percentage of the amount you’re sending. The percentage varies from currency to currency. You can check it out on _our pricing page_. If you're only sending a small amount of money, there's an inexpensive minimum fee.

You will be charged VAT or any other tax according to applicable Philippines tax laws.

 **Where can I send from?**

You can only send PHP to Wise from banks within the Philippines. You can’t send PHP from an overseas bank.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

It usually takes 0–1 working days for your money to get to us, depending on the amount for your transfer. Then, we convert it and send it out. 

Conversion can take up to 2 working days. To see how long it will take for the money to arrive in your recipient's account, check out the guide for the currency you're sending to.

 **I’ve cancelled my payment, how long will my refund take?**

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. Your refunds will take up to 2 working days to process. We might need more information before sending your refund. We’ll send you an email if we do. This might result in longer processing times. 

Make sure to wait until the above time frame has passed before getting in touch about a refund — we’re not able to speed up the process.
