## Getting your business verified in the UK and EEA  
When you sign up to Wise, you’ll need to give some details about your business. It’s part of how we’re regulated, and it helps keep your money safe.

Learn more about business verification.

What we ask for will vary depending on your company type. We may reach out to you for more information or documents — so keep an eye on your email. 

### Business name, company type and registration number

We’ll ask for basic business details including:

  * your business name

  * your company type

  * official registration number — depending on the country, this number might have a different name 




We may also ask for your business registration document or certificate.

### Business registered address

This is the address where your business is officially registered with a government body. 

### Business trading address

This is usually where you work every day, or where customers contact you. It can be your office, co-working space, shop, studio or home.

You won’t need to add a separate trading address if it’s the same as your registered address.

### Details about your business activities

This can include:

  * details about the products you sell, or services you provide

  * a link to your business website or online storefront, if you have one




The more information you can give us about your business, the faster we’ll verify it.

### How your business will use Wise

We’ll ask you about:

  * your reason for using a Wise business account

  * the expected monthly volumes you’ll move

  * the countries you’ll send money to and receive money from




### Source of business funds

We’d like to understand how you’ll fund your Wise business account. For example, if your money comes from your business activities, you could provide bank statements from the last 3 months or annual statements. If it comes from loans or funding, you could provide loan agreements or contracts.

### Business owners (Ultimate Beneficial Owners)

We’ll need details of anyone who directly or indirectly owns 25% or more of the company, or who exercises control over the company. We’ll need their:

  * full name

  * date of birth

  * country of residence




We’ll also ask for a clear copy of a photo ID for each beneficial owner, and may need a document to prove who the beneficial owners are. 

### Personal details and ID for the account owner

We need this information to make sure the account owner is authorised to act on behalf of the business.

We’ll ask for your personal details and a clear photo of your ID, so we can verify your identity.

We may sometimes ask for a signed letter from an authorised representative of the business confirming your authority. The letter has to be in a non-editable format — JPEG, PNG or PDF.

### Business directors

We’ll ask for the full name, date of birth and country of residence for each director.

If you’re a sole trader, you won’t need to give this information.
