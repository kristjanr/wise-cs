## Retrieving your Proof of Payment from Japanese Bank Account  
#### If you have been asked to upload a Proof of Payment, you will need to send us documents that demonstrate you have sent us funds from your bank account.

1\. If you would like to use your **ATM receipt** as Proof of Payment, please make sure we can see your partial bank details. We will also need an additional document to confirm the payment was made from your bank account. In most cases, this can be the first inside page of your bank book or a screenshot of your online banking that shows account holder name and account details on the same page.

2\. Alternatively, you can access **online banking** to retrieve your Proof of Payment.

We will need to be able to see your account holder name on the same page as the transaction to Wise so that we can identify where the funds came from. If you are unable to upload a Proof of Payment that shows your account holder name on the transaction page, please make sure you upload the following documents:

  *  **Bank statement that shows your transaction to Wise along with your bank account number**

  * Copy of online banking, Bank Statement or Bank Book that shows **account holder name (口座名義人)** and **bank account number (口座番号)** _on the same page._




Please note:

  *  _We are not able to accept the remitter field (依頼人名) as account holder name_ as this field can be edited.

  *  _We are not able to accept card images as account holder details._ Please upload your bank account details from a photo/screenshot of your Bank Book (first inside page) or your online banking platform.

  *  _We are not able to accept translated documents._
