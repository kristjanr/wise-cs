## Verify your US business  
US business verification requirements are different for each company type. 

We’ll always ask the named account holder to enter their Social Security number (SSN) in addition to the supporting business documents. If your SSN is not accepted, then you can verify yourself with an ID.

Entering the SSN is a completely secure, one-time only verification process that we have to do as part of how we’re regulated in the US. We don’t run a credit check, or share your number.

All business documents need to be stamped and/or signed by a government body for us to accept and verify them.

Due to licensing limitations, we’re unable to onboard businesses from Nevada, and US territories (Virgin Islands, Guam, Mariana Islands).
