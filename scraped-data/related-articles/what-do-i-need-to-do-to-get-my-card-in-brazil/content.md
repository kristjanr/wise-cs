## What do I need to do to get my card in Brazil?  
To keep you and your account safe, you’ll need to go through the following steps to get your card.

 **1.Verify your ID**

Like your bank, Wise is a regulated financial institution. To comply with local regulations (the Central Bank) and our banking partner agreements, we need to verify a valid Brazilian identification document before any customers order a debit card in Brazil. We can accept:

  * A national ID issued less than 15 years ago

  * Brazilian passport

  * National driver’s license

  * RNE




 **2\. Add BRL to your balance**

We will ask you to open a BRL balance and top it up. Ordering your Wise card is free and the amount that you add is yours to spend at any time. 

**3\. Set up your PIN**

You’ll get to set your own 4-digit PIN when you order your card. 

**4\. Track your order**

You’ll get an email from us once you’ve completed the steps above and your order is ready. You’ll also get an email with a delivery estimate from _Loggi_ or **Mobi**, so you can track your card. Please bear in mind the card will only be delivered if someone is there to receive it. After you finish the order, you can start using your card details online or with your mobile wallet before you get your physical card.
