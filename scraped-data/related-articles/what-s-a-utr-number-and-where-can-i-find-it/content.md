## What's a UTR number, and where can I find it?  
A UTR number (unique transaction reference) is a unique reference code that is attached to every transfer sent to India. 

On the recipient bank statement, the UTR number is visible on the received transfer. The exact format of the number can differ according to payment method.

The UTR number can also be used to trace a payment if the money hasn’t been received. If that’s the case, and your transfer has been held up, please download your PDF transfer receipt (click on your transfer in Activity, then on View transfer details, then Get PDF receipt).

You can also find your UTR number on the email Wise sends you when you make a transfer.
