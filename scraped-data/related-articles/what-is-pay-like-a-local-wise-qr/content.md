## What is pay like a local / Wise QR?  
QR payments are a convenient way to pay, especially in countries where card payments are not widely accepted yet.

 **Note: Sorry, customers can’t scan PayNow QR codes to pay in Singapore at the moment. We’re working hard to change this. This doesn’t impact customers who are funding their Wise SGD balance and transactions with PayNow.**

With Wise QR, you can pay just like a local does in many countries – just like you do with your Wise card – but using only your phone and camera.

 **How do I pay with Wise QR?**

  * In your Card tab, swipe the Card carousel to the left to bring up Pay Like a Local.

  * Tap either ‘Scan QR code’ or ‘Import QR code.’

  * Find a supported QR code and scan it.

  * Follow the steps to confirm your payment.

  * Done!

The support for PayNow QR code is currently on hold. We’re working hard to change this. More regions and ways to pay will also be available in the near future.
