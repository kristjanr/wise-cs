## Fee refunds for customers in the UK  
###  **What are fee refunds?**

Currently, we’re offering fee refunds to a trial group of customers in the United Kingdom.

###  **Why is Wise giving fee refunds?**

We _keep money safe_ in accounts that are separate from the ones we use to run our business. The accounts are approved by the regulators. Your money is not at risk. 

We are now starting to generate income from the money we keep safe. It is our customers’ money so we believe it's right to give it back as a refund on the fees we charged.

Our mission is to make your money work without borders — instant, convenient, transparent and eventually free. See how _you can help_.

###  **How do we calculate fee refunds?**

We calculate refunds based on the total fees you paid using Wise in the previous month. 

The percentage of the total fees refunded can vary. The amount may change or stop depending on your account activity and how much it costs to keep your money safe.

The refund is paid into the GBP balance in your Wise account. 

### **Who's eligible for a fee refund?**

 **You’ll receive a refund for fees paid on:**
