## What documents can I upload to prove my source of wealth?  
We may ask you to upload a document that proves how you earn your money. This is called your source of wealth, and is a regulatory requirement for some regions. 

Different countries and currencies have different requirements and we sometimes need to ask for more information. 

We’d like this process to go smoothly for you, so please ensure that all information is visible — we can’t accept documents that have been cropped or that have redacted information.

If you cancel your transfer while the documents are being reviewed, the process will be stopped, and you may need to re-submit your documents again in the future.
