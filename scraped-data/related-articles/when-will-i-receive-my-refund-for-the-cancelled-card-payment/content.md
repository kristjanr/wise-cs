## When will I receive my refund for the cancelled card payment?  
Due to the way banks process refunds to a card, they can take a maximum of 10 working days, but are typically reflected back in your account in 2–5 working days. Unfortunately, there’s nothing we can do to speed up this process. 

If you’ve been waiting for more than 10 working days, please get in touch with us so we can check if something’s gone wrong. 

After cancelling the payment, your bank should be able to update you on the status of your refund.
