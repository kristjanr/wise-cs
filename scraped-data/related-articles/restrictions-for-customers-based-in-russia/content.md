## Restrictions for Customers based in Russia  
We’re not able to serve customers in Russia at the moment. This means we’re closing all Wise accounts with addresses registered in Russia on 9 May 2022. Here’s what will happen, and what you need to do. 

**1\. EUR currency accounts for customers in Russia will stop working on 10 March 2022**

This means you won't be able to receive any EUR payments using your Wise account, including direct debits. You should move or convert money in this account now.

All payments sent to your EUR account details after March 10th should return to the sender’s bank account. 

**2\. You'll only be able to withdraw money from your account from 11 March 2022**

You’ll only be able to withdraw money from your Wise account and no longer be able to add money to your Wise account. This means:

  * If you still hold RUB with us, you can transfer those to RUB bank accounts which are not subject to any global sanctions in Russia 

  * During weekdays, you can convert your RUB to other currencies and make transfers to bank accounts outside of Russia

  * If you hold EUR or USD or other supported currencies, you can only send those funds to an account outside of Russia. 

  * Any payments or top-ups to your account will be rejected and sent back to the sender.




 **3\. Move all money out of your Wise account within 60 days**

We'll close Wise accounts of customers in Russia on 9 May, 2022. This means you have to move money out of your Wise account (across all currencies), and download any important information.

 **4\. Not accepting ID documents issued by the Russian government for verification purposes**

We won't be able to accept ID documents issued by the Russian government for new customers from 18 March 2022. Should we need to re-verify your profile, we are also not able to accept ID documents issued by the Russian government.

 **Why is this happening?**

The impact of ongoing sanctions and recent developments in the region mean it’s getting increasingly difficult for us to operate in Russia. This may mean it becomes more difficult or even impossible for you to access services like Wise or withdraw your money in the future.

We know this is a very difficult situation — and we’re so sorry. If you have any questions, our support team is here to help.
