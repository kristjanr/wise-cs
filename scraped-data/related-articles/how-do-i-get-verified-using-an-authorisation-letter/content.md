## How do I get verified using an authorisation letter?  
Depending on your position, we may ask you to prove you're authorised to use and communicate with Wise on behalf of the business. Authorisation can be granted with a letter signed by a director, board member, managing partner, or significant controller of the company. You can't authorise it for yourself.

You can download a template below, according to where the business is registered. Make sure to have it ready when we ask for it.
