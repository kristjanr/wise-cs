## What do you need to verify my Singapore business?  
We need to verify your business before you can make a business transfer from Singapore in Singapore dollars (SGD), or activate any balances. It’s how we keep your money safe, and comply with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulations.

### How do I start using Wise for my incorporated Singapore business?

Sign up for your business

  * Enter your company’s name and ACRA (or UEN) registration number.

  * Tell us about your business and how you’re planning to use Wise.

  * If your company has a website, we’ll need that too. You can add this to your profile. 

  * We’ll then need information for all of your directors, and shareholders that own more than 25% of the business:

    * Full name, date of birth, and country of residence

    * If one of the shareholders is another business; then we’ll also need their company registry document that show the owners of that business




 **Create your** **personal account**

You can’t have a Wise Business account without also having a personal account attached to it. And we can only verify your business account **after** verifying your personal account.

You’ll need to provide this information when creating your personal account:

  * Your ID document with nationality 

  * Proof of address

  * If you are not a director, you’ll need to provide an authorisation letter from the directors before we can verify your account




That’s it! We’ll be in touch if we need more information, so make sure to check your email. It may take us 4–7 working days, but we’ll try our best to speed things up. If you set up your first transfer before we verify your account, we’ll send the money to your recipient once everything is verified.

### How do I start using Wise Business to send transfers from SGD if my company is incorporated outside of Singapore?

You can still set up a transfer from SGD, but we’ll ask for more information from you. We’ll ask for,

  * An ID of the highest ranking director 

  * A company registry document that shows details of all shareholders of the company

  * We’ll also need documents for the personal account verification:

    * Your ID with nationality 

    * Proof of address; this needs to match the personal account address




### Is there anything else I need to know?

All businesses incorporated in Singapore must be registered with ACRA to use Wise Business. 

Trusts and charities can’t use Wise to send money from Singapore 

All business accounts must be in line with our Acceptable Use Policy.
