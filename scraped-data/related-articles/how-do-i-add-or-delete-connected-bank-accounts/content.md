## How do I add or delete connected bank accounts?  
When you make an ACH payment by connecting your bank account, we automatically save your account details for future use. 

You can view your connected accounts on the website, and that's where you can connect new accounts or disconnect unused ones. 

#### Connecting a new bank account

  1. Log in to your account on the website.

  2. Click on your initials, or on your profile picture on the top right corner.

  3. Select **Settings.**

  4. Go to **Connected accounts.**

  5. Click **Connect your bank account.**

  6. Follow the steps on the screen.




#### Disconnecting a bank account

  1. Log in to your account on the website.

  2. Click on your initials, or on your profile picture on the top right corner. 

  3. Select **Settings.**

  4. Go to **Connected accounts.**

  5. Click on the **Delete** button next to the account you'd like to disconnect.




Once you connect an account, you can't edit it. If you need to make changes to your account information, you'll need to delete that account and connect it again.
