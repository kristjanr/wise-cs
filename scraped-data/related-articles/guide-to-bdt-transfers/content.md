 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

 **Are there any restrictions on sending to BDT?**

You can’t send business transfers to BDT. 

**What’s the cash incentive for sending money to Bangladesh?**

The Bangladeshi government has announced a program called the Cash Incentive for Inward Wage Remittances. It means that if you’re a Bangladesh national who’s working abroad, you can get a 2% cash incentive for any amount you send back to Bangladesh.

We send the cash incentive to the recipient, not the sender.

 **How does it work?**

If you’re sending up to 500,000 BDT, you won’t need to provide any documents to receive the incentive. For any amount above 500,000 BDT, the recipient’s bank will ask the recipient to send through the documents below. These documents are for the sender, not the recipient.

  * passport

  * appointment letter,

  * certificate given from Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET)

  * copy of trade licence (in case of remittance generated from business proceeds)




Recipients need to send these documents to their bank within 5 working days to get the cash incentive.

The documents should take about 2 working days to review. Once approved, we’ll send the incentive directly to the recipient’s bank account — this should take 1–2 working days.
