### Sending to NOK

 **Who can I send NOK to?**

You can send NOK to any bank account in Norway.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need their full name and bank account number. In Norway, this is a code called an IBAN which is usually 15 characters long, containing a mix of letters and numbers, and starting with NO.

Some businesses in Norway may ask for a KID reference number with your payment, which they use to check who sent them money. If you need it, enter this number as the reference for your payment. It’s important that you only include the reference number and no text. 

**How much can I send?**

You can send up to 11.5 million NOK per transfer.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once we receive and convert your money, it usually takes 1 working day to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days. 

We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

We’ll let you know when we’ve refunded your money. The time it takes for you to get your refund depends on how you paid, 

  * Bank transfers take up to 1 working day

If you paid by bank transfer, we might need more information before sending your refund. We’ll send you an email if we do.
