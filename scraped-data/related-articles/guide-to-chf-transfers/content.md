### Sending to CHF

 **Who can I send CHF to?**

You can send CHF to any CHF bank account in Switzerland or Liechtenstein.

 **What information do I need about my recipient?**

You’ll need the recipient’s full name and their IBAN. This should be 21 characters long and begin with CH. 

**Can I pay by QR-type IBAN (QR-bill)?**

Yes. To do this, you’ll need two codes found on the QR bill your recipient sent you:

  * The QR IBAN, which is 21 digits. It starts with CH, and its fifth digit is 3. This is found at the top of the invoice

  * The QR reference, which is 27 digits. This is found in the section below the QR-IBAN




When you’re setting up your payment on Wise, enter the QR-IBAN into the IBAN field. In the next step, when you are confirming your payment, you need to add the QR reference. This option is found at the bottom of the screen. If you don’t enter your QR reference, your payment won’t be successful.

 **How much can I send?**

This depends on our limits on the currency you're sending from. If you go under or above it, we'll tell you.

 **How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?**

Once Wise receives and converts your money, it takes 1-3 working days to arrive in your recipient’s account.
