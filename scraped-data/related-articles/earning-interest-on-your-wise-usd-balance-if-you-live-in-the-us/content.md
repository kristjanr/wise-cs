## Earning interest on your Wise USD balance if you live in the US  
####  **How does it work?**

Since Wise isn’t a bank, we keep our customers’ money safe by storing funds with reputable banks. These banks then pay Wise interest on those funds for keeping the money with them. 

For eligible customers that opt in, we take the interest earned from our program bank(s) on your USD funds, use a small portion to cover our operating expenses, and pass the rest along to you. Plus, through our relationship with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., your USD balance will be eligible for up to 250,000 USD in FDIC pass through insurance. (Certain Limitations Apply - see _Program Agreement_ for more details) when you opt in.

####  **Who is eligible?**

All new and existing US customers with a SSN/EIN will be eligible to opt in (SSN/EIN verification will be required during opt in, unless already verified). We need this to verify your tax information so that we can report your taxes correctly. Please note this feature is not available to residents of New York and Alaska at this time. 

#### **I don’t live in the US but my business is located in the US, am I eligible?**

Yes, if your business is registered in the US and has an EIN, it would be eligible to add the interest feature to its Wise Account. We'll verify your EIN when you opt in, unless it's already been verified.

Your personal account wouldn't be eligible as your address isn't located in the US.

####  **I’m a US citizen but my business is located abroad, am I eligible?**

Yes, if your personal account has a US address and you have a SSN, you are eligible to add the interest feature. We'll verify your SSN when you opt in, unless it's already been verified. 

Your business account wouldn't be eligible, as it is not based in the US.

####  **Can I still send and spend money from my Wise Account?**

Yes! You can still send, spend, receive and convert money at your discretion. 

####  **What is the interest rate for this feature?**

The interest rate is currently 4.13% APY. Interest rates are variable and determined by our program bank(s), so the interest rate is subject to change. (See _Program Agreement_ for more details)

####  **When will I receive interest into my Wise Account?**

Any interest you earn this month will be paid at the beginning of the following month, added directly to your USD balance.

####  **How do I opt in?**

After you’ve opened a multi-currency account with Wise, navigate to your USD balance and select “earn interest.” Wise will need to verify your SSN or EIN before you can start using this feature.

####  **How do I opt out?**

You can opt out at any time through your Wise Account. Go to your USD Balance and choose “Opt out.” If you decide to opt out, you’ll still earn interest for the month until the day you cancel. Any interest owed prior to you opting out will still be paid to your USD Balance. 

####  **How does Wise calculate interest?**

We calculate interest daily based on your minimum daily balance. This means that any money that you add to your USD balance on a given day will start earning interest on the next working day. 

####  **I have other currencies in my Wise Account, will those earn interest too?**

Interest is only earned on your USD balance. 

#### **Can I earn interest on money in my jars?**

Today, customers can only earn interest on USD in their main USD balance. 

#### **Are there any fees?**

There are no fees for opting into, or using this feature. We do however take a portion of the interest earned to cover our operating expenses.

####  **Why didn’t Wise offer this before?**

With the positive interest rates market, we can now cover our costs with a portion of the interest we earn through our program bank(s). That means the rest of the interest we earn can be passed along to you!

####  **What if I decide to close my Wise Account?**

You’ll still earn interest up until the day you close your account. Rather than receiving the interest payment into your USD balance, we’ll send the money to your linked card or bank account. 

#### **What does this mean for my taxes?**

For most users, interest earned on the USD balance in their Wise Account will be taxed as ordinary income in the year it is received. For all customers who earn more than $10.00 in interest, Wise will issue you a Form 1099-INT annually. 

Wise is not a tax advisor, and you should consult with a tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of earning interest on the USD Balance in your Wise Account.

####  **What happens if I relocate outside of the US after opting in?**

If you relocate outside of the US, your Wise Account will no longer be eligible for this feature. You’ll receive any interest accrued during the month you move, up until the date of your address change. We pay this out at the beginning of the following month. The same applies if you relocate your business outside the US. If you a relocate to the UK, EEA, or Singapore, you may be eligible for similar features, called Assets. 

You might also be eligible for fee refunds if you move to the UK or a balance cashback if you move to the EEA Learn more about Assets

#### **How is Wise able to offer this feature under its current licenses?**

Wise is not a licensed brokerage or bank in the United States, so we can’t offer any securities, investments, or traditional savings accounts. Instead, the interest you’re earning, along with the FDIC insurance that comes with it, is passed through from our program bank(s).
