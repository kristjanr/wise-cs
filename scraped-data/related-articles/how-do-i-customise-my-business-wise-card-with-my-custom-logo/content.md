## How do I customise my Business Wise Card with my Custom Logo?  
## Can I get a Custom Logo Wise Card?

You can now get your Wise Card customised if you're an Admin of a Wise Business account registered in the EU. We're working on making this available in even more regions and entities.

If you already have a Wise card, you can order a Custom Logo Wise Card to replace the existing one on your Wise Business account. You can continue using the existing card until the new Custom Logo card is activated. 

## How do I customise my Wise Card?

#### 1\. Go on the Custom Logo page.

You can also go on **Customise your cards** in the Cards tab, or on **Wise Business card customisation** in the ****Manage your account tab. 

#### 2\. Upload your Custom Logo.

To personalise your cards, we’ll ask you to upload a Custom Logo in .png, .jpeg or .jpg format at a minimum resolution of 1323px by 781px. We'll then convert the logo to monochrome, with no gradients, and can resize and adjust it to fit your card however you like.

Read the **Custom Logo Best Practices** below for the best quality of your final printed design.

#### 3\. We review your Custom Logo

Our team will review the image using our guidelines. This can take up to 2 business days. We'll keep you updated on the Custom Logo page and by email.

Check approval times in our **Custom Logo Guidelines** below.

#### 4\. Order your customised cards

Once we've approved your Custom Logo, the status on the Custom Logo page changes and the **Custom Logo Switch** is automatically turned on. You can now order cards normally from the Card tab. 

Every card you order after your Custom Logo has been approved will be printed with your new design, as long as the **Custom Logo Switch** is on. You can toggle the switch on or off, in case you don't want some of your cards to have the custom design.

## Custom Logo Best Practices

Printing your Custom Logo on your Wise Card is a physical process ─ the quality and detail of the final result depend on the design you upload.

Review what you uploaded in the **preview image** before ordering your cards. Clean, sharp images work best. We can’t guarantee that the quality of the physical print will always match more complicated designs, but here are some suggestions for the best experience.

#### No fine lines

Extremely fine lines won't print well on your card. Try to keep your lines more than 1 pixel wide. Fine lines can either print at different sizes, or clump together.

#### No rescaled curves

Because the prints on your Custom Logo card don't support anti-aliasing, rescaling curves will make jagged edges. So if you’re rescaling curves, check the image in the preview.

#### No gradients

Because the printing process is monochrome, gradients will turn into solid shapes.

#### Watch your colours

The printing process is monochrome, so all the colours are converted into a single shade of white. Use monochrome logos, and check the image in the preview.

## Custom Logo Guidelines

Because of our regulations, we need to manually review every design you upload before we can print it on your cards. 

Here's what we don't allow on Custom Logo Cards:

#### No licensed content

You can't print content that you don't own, or whose copyright is owned by someone else. This includes copyrighted characters, logos from brands that aren't yours, and the likeness of people or characters that aren't in the public domain.

#### No offensive content

You can't print content that Wise deems offensive. For instance, discriminatory slurs or imagery, violent, religious or political imagery, references to fictional or historical facts, and people or events that might be offensive to one or several groups of people. 

## My design was rejected. What do I do?

If we rejected your design, we'll tell you why by email and on the Custom Logo page. You can choose a different Custom Logo that complies with our guidelines, and start the upload process again.
