## Why does it say you're waiting for my money?  
There’s two possible reasons for this — either, you paid in via bank transfer and your money hasn’t reached us yet, or you didn’t pay in.

If it’s the former, there’s nothing to worry about, we should have your money soon. 

If it’s the latter, you need to click on your transfer, write down our bank details (including your reference number), and pay in to us from your online bank before we can continue with the transfer.
