## What countries can I send USD to?  
For most countries/regions you can send USD to, we are protecting your payment.

Wise covers the fee automatically if we predict that your payment might get charged. To predict these fees, we have built a **prediction tool** for the correspondent bank fees and speed, based on historical data. 

Check the table below to see what countries you can send to, and how much payment protection costs:

When we predict that no correspondent fees will be charged, we only charge a sending fee of 2.90 USD. When we predict that some fees will be charged, we charge 14 USD. This way, we make sure that you pay as little as possible, and that your recipient is receiving the right amount.

We'll let you know if you enter the SWIFT code of a country we don't accept, when setting up your transfer.
