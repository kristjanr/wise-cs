## Getting verified in New Zealand  
When you send New Zealand dollars (NZD) with Wise, we’ll need to verify your identity before you get started. It’s how we keep your money safe and comply with regulations. It usually takes 1–2 working days.

### Verifying your personal account

When you send NZD with your personal Wise account, we’ll ask you to send us a colour scan of a document that proves your identity. This could be:

  * passport (including signature and machine-readable zone)

  * New Zealand driver’s licence

  * New Zealand firearms licence (as long as it contains a photo)

  * national ID card (front and back)




We’ll also ask you to send us a scan of a document that proves your address. Most people send a bank statement or utility bill. It should show:

  * your name

  * your full personal address

  * date of issue

  * logo, or clear name of the sender (your bank, your local authority, your utilities provider)

  * nature of the document (type of bill, subject of the letter)




Learn more about verifying your address

It’s important that the document has the same details listed in your Wise account, like name, birthday, and address. So you might want to edit your account first.

Once you’ve uploaded your proof of identity, we’ll send you a confirmation email within 2 workday days. We might email you with a request for more information, too.

Once we’ve verified your identity, you can get started sending NZD.

### Verifying your Wise Business account

If you’d like to send NZD for your business you’ll need a Wise Business account. It’ll be attached to your personal account, and we’ll need to verify that first.

To verify your business, we need to check the identity and address of all directors and shareholders who own 25% or more of the business. We’ll also ask for documents that help us confirm that your business is registered, and how it operates. And depending on your business type, we might need more information, too. 

If you're not the director or a shareholder of the company, we'll ask you to provide an authorisation letter, or a board resolution from the company, confirming that you’re authorised to use and communicate with Wise on behalf of the business. You can download a template of the authorisation letter, and have it ready when we ask for it.
