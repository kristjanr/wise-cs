##  **Sending money**

###  **How can I send Chinese Yuan (CNY) to a UnionPay recipient with Wise?**

  1. Log into your Wise personal account, and set up a transfer to CNY.

  2. Choose UnionPay under **Bank details** , then tell us who you're sending to by entering your recipient's name (in Latin characters only), and the UnionPay Card Number.

  3. Check that all details are correct before paying for your transfer.




And that's it!

###  **Who can I send to?**

You can only send to a personal recipient via UnionPay. We don'ts support business recipients.

You can only send to UnionPay cards connected to CNY bank accounts. The recipient's bank account should be opened with their Chinese National ID. The account needs to support UnionPay’s MoneyExpress service, too.

  * Bank of Nanjing

##  **Receiving Money**

Once the money reaches your recipient’s bank, they'll get an SMS message from their bank. The money will go into their account automatically.

### How long does it usually take for the money to arrive?

Once we get and convert your money, it usually gets to your recipient’s bank account on the same working day.

If your recipient reached the daily receiving limit, the money will get there the next day.

###  **I entered the wrong UnionPay card number. What should I do?**

If you added the UnionPay card number and got an error message, it means that UnionPay can't send transfers to that recipient. 

Read the section above under “Who can I send to?” and double-check with your recipient that they gave you the right UnionPay card number. 

We can't recall payments that were sent to the wrong recipient. When setting up a UnionPay transfer, check the card number to ensure you're sending it to the right recipient.

###  **Why was my transfer cancelled?**

Your transfer could be cancelled and refunded for many reasons. For example, your recipient reached their receiving limit, or their account is blocked. Your transfer might also be cancelled if you send funds from a country that UnionPay doesn't support.

###  **My recipient didn't get the funds. What can I do?**

Check with your recipient if they got an SMS text about the transfer. You should also check if they can give you bank statements to trace the payment.

###  **Can I cancel a transfer that I have already sent?**

You can't cancel or recall a transfer that has been sent.
