## How do I make an appeal?  
We know it can be frustrating to have your account closed. We’ll never close an account for no reason. 

Learn why we deactivate accounts 

You can always appeal our decision, and we’ll review your details again to see if we can reactivate your account. 

After appealing, you’ll need to wait for our team to reach out to you with updates. Customer Support doesn’t have the ability to provide updates or speed up the process for you. 

Make an appeal

When you make an appeal, we’ll ask you to:

  * Upload a high-quality photo or colour scan of your _photo ID_. 

  * Upload a _photograph of yourself (selfie) holding your photo ID_. 

  * Tell us your reason for sending money. We need to understand why you’re sending money for previous or future transfers.

  * If you still have money on your account, tell us the details of the bank account where we should send the refund.




After you’ve sent us this information, we’ll review it and will be in touch about your account.
