## Who can use the Wise API?  
Businesses and banks like N26, Monzo, Telleroo, Cashongo, Hubstaff, LHV, Rentify, and more are already harnessing the power of Wise API. And the feedback has been great.

We recently shared an example of how we collaborated with Codementor to save both them and their customers money. Now we’ve made the same API available to you.

We have even bigger platforms gearing up to join us as well. We’re currently working with one of the largest French banks, BPCE, on an integration that will let their customers make payments with Wise, without leaving their BPCE online banking or app.

The possibilities are endless. Use our API to:

  * Power your cross-border and domestic payouts with a single API integration

  * Pay out directly to bank accounts or email recipients automatically 

  * Monitor payments received to your Wise local account details (AUD, EUR, GBP, USD)

  * Get statements for balance reconciliation and accounting purposes

  * Fully automate transfer creation and track statuses

  * Always get the mid-market exchange rate and our low cost transparent fees
