## How can I pay with a new card?  
**To pay with a different debit or credit card:**

  1. Set up a transfer as you normally would

  2. At the final step, choose Add a new card

  3. Enter the new card details




To remove saved cards, go to your **Settings** and choose **Your saved bank cards**. You’ll then be able to remove the details of any cards you don’t want to use any more. You can only do this on the web, not the app.
