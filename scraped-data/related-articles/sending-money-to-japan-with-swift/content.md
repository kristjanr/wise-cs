## Sending money to Japan with SWIFT  
All transfers to Japan which are over 1 million JPY are now paid out via SWIFT. These transfers incur an additional flat fee on top of our regular % fee. The flat fee differs depending on the currency you’re sending from, and you can see all of the fees below. If your address is in Japan, you can send up to 1 million JPY **per transfer**.

Our flat fees cover all usual SWIFT charges. So intermediary and beneficiary bank fees shouldn’t be charged on your transfer. But some beneficiary bank may charge your recipient for something else than receiving SWIFT payments. Unfortunately, there’s no way for Wise to know what this will be in advance.
