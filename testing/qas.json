        "question": "What is Interest and why is it low risk?",
        "answer": "Interest refers to holding money in funds known as 'public debt constant net asset value' (CNAV) short-term money market funds.

Scenarios include negative interest rates or governments going bankrupt, but these are extremely unlikely."

        "question": "What is the fund management fee?",
